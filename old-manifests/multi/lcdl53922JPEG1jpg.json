In the days of long ago, this Park was part of the old Washington Race Track, and under its great oaks, near the river, many famous duels were fought. In 1901-02 it was used for the South Carolina Inter-State and West Indian Exposition, but only here and there can a trace of that time be seen. It is beautiful with its sunken garden; and in the Spring it abounds in a wealth of lovely roses and a profusion of various kinds of flowers.\"",
