      "value": "Charleston August 19th, 1853.\nMy dear Esther,\ni long to hear how you are, particularly as I think an interesting event must ere this have occurred in the family.\nAnn was with us from the 9th. June, looking very well, and really much stronger than she usually is. She came with the intention of spending the whole summer here, but Gabriel arrived from Mobile in bad health, and after a week or two became so much worse that a change to the North was recommended by his Physician, but to which he was averse; upon which she offered to go immediately with him, as an inducement going to her house; and perhaps traveling together. \nPreparations were made, and much done on Ann's part to get your Aunt ready to join them, and on the 25 July, your Aunt, Louisa, Ann, Mani. Gabriel and Peter left us in the William Gibbons for N.[New] York. The two former had been staying at Mrs. Thompson's, corner of Meeting and Cumberland streets. They arrived on the following Wednesday, and were to go to the succeeding Monday, in a body to the Sasatoga Springs, where P. and G. were to stay only a day or two, and proceed to Niagara and Boston; Ann's family one week, and to return to N.Y.[New York]; my Sister and\n[end of page one]\nLouisa to remain three[sic], and then go to Newport. Mr. Taylor in March was taken with the quinsy, and ever since has had a relaxed throat and palate, attened[sic] with constant hoarseness and feverish feelings. At this season his Church is usually closed and he has not officiated for six weeks, but Ann found him much the same as she had left him.\nYour Cousin Mrs. B. Gibbes after a long illness much suffering has been released! How probably [illegible as page is torn] it to human eyes that her life might be long and [ever?] happy, as she had the appearance of strength, and [illegible due to tear in page]\nthe requesite means for worldly comfort, and well-being. \nI have not seen Cousin Sarah since this event and I have not met with Mrs. Ann Gibbes, as you know the [illegible as page is torn] never \"at home,\" or rather, is always \"engaged.\" \nMrs. James Gibbes's eldest son was sent to school in N.[New] York, and from whence he returned in bad health some weeks ago -- she has taken him into the upper country. \nJudge Huger's family, with the exception of Mrs. Lounders are at the Waterre -- the girls went up very reluctantly and I have lately heard that Mr. [and] Mrs. H[Huger] have been both as dispeptic[sic], that they are rather out of concert with the rendince[sic]; to the great joy of the rest of the family I suppose. \n[end of page two]\nDid you hear of Mrs. Edward Pringle's daughter on the 4th of July at. N. York? little Bethia Skivoing, after his particular friend Mrs. J.\nVery pleasing letters have been received from Mrs. Arthur Middleton in France, where she went for her daughters health. She sees much to admire, to please and to approve excepting the manner of spending Sunday, where it is very little regarded as a Holy-day; members of previous continuing their weekly work as usual; articles of every description are expound for sale along the public walks; crowds of people are walking dressed as if for a ball [illegible due to a tear in the paper] with Cafes even the little children ornamentated with large [illegible due to a tear in the paper] of artifice[artificial] flowers [and] carrying in their hands large [bouquets?] of natural ones, who are sometimes attracted by the different stages where little dramas are performed, or where the anticks[sic] and grimmiaces[sic] of monkies[sic] or dogs are the object of amusement! She describes the scenery on the Seine as beautiful indeed--. Anne was much better; they are to visit England and in eighteen months to return home.\nOur old Friend Mrs. Ferguson has been gradually sinking for some months past, and she is now very sick and low; but her state of mind is happy.\nI hope you have escaped all alarm from thou unprincipled gamblers and incendiaries who have been routed \n[end of page three]\nin your neighbourhood-- there has been much excitement at the part that many have taken against us in the Northern States -- in the South there is but one voice, \"our rights respected or disunion of the States!\"\nHenry and Edward have made an excursion on the water to day with some of their friends they have had a time today.\n[skips the middle of the page and continues at the bottom]\nYour Uncle joins me in Love to you all my dear Ester - Wilmot I suppose will join you in a couple of months-- my earnest with it that God! May prosper you!\nYours [affectionately]\nCharlotte Manigault\n[written in the middle of the page vertically]\n[in different ink]25\nMiss Ester M. Gibbes\nAmsterdam\nMississipi[sic].\n[stamp] Charleston August 2[Illegible]\n[end of page four]"
