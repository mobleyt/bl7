She stated that she had visited Toedo whare planning officias thought that the Civic Services Committe\"s process of one project at a time had a better chance of survliving than the aover Toedo plan.   Mr. Stoney asked if the committee would favor advocating a zoning ordinance that would require a new buildings or remodeing in the restricted sections of King street to step back 10 feet from existing buiding ines. He advocated this as a deterrent to the remodeing or destruction of existing buildings. Mr. Mitchell stated that in his opinion this would be difficult of achievement and the Chairman requested Mr. Stoney to investigate the matter in reference to the China Hall buiding on King and iberty.   Mr. Whitelaw reported that the Committee\" s off-street parking plan had been presented to City Council on November 13th and that no action had boon taken with the exception of the appointment of a committee of 8 from City Counci. Considerable discussion followed. Mr. Briggs stated that as cost seemed to be the only reason why the plan was not adopted that the Civic Services Cormnittee should advocate that the city experiment with one bock. Mr. Staats and Mr. Whitelaw objected to this stating that the plan as presented. was the minimum for successfu operation. Mr. Mitchell advocated etting the matter rest until the Committee from City Council had studied the plan. This meeting agreed, but was of the opinion that everything possible be done to keop the issue before the Public.   A report was made that 208 Twenty-Five doar members had been secured and it was agreed that Mr. Whitelaw, Mr. place, Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Todd plan the continuance of the campaign as only haf the necossory minimum budget for overa planning had been secured.
