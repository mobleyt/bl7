      "value": "City of Charleston Executive Department  E.EDWARD WEHMAN,JR.  MAYOR  September 8, 1945  Mr. Robert N. S. Whitelaw, Director,  Civic Services Committee,  Carolina Art Associaltion,  Charleston, S. C.  Dear Bob:  Acknowedging receipt of yours of September 7th,  whenever your Committee has further plans after study  with reference to the off-street parking, I do think that  these plans should be presented before the Ways and Means  Committee and then that Committee to make recommendations  to City Counci.  At the present time, we are not contempating  having a meeting of the Ways and Means Committee on  September 13th, as City Council meets on September 11th,  and It is aways our plan to aow sufficient work to  accumuate so that the Committee may take up a matters  possible at one time rather than to call Additional  meetings.  In other words, at this time of the year  especiay, the members of the Committee do not want to  have any more meetings than necessary and I quite agree  with them in this regard.  Under norma conditions, after the September 11th  meeting of City Counci, the next meeting of City Council  is sated for October 9th and I do not anticipate any  change in schedule as to City Council meeting uness, of  course, the Ports Authority matter or something of that  nature would make it necessary to call a special meeting  of City Council ater in September.  Beginning in October,  however, City Council goes back to its reguar schedule of  meeting the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month.\n\n[End Page 1]\nMr. Robert N. S. Whitelaw -2  I really do not want to disrupt your plans in  any way but I do not think it will quite be possible to  have a meeting of the Ways and Means Committee next Thursday,  If you will keep in touch with me, I will advise you when  it is expected to call the next meeting of the Ways and  Means Committee, as there are several matters which will  require the attention of the Committee within the next two  or three weeks.  I just want to pass this information on to you  and will be gad to have any further remarks In regard  to the same.  Sincerely yours,  Ned  E. Edward Wehman, Jr.,  Mayor  EEWJr:S\n\n[End Page 2]"
