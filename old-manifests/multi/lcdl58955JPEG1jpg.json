      "value": "A Review of the Work of the   Charleston regional planning Committee,  an Estimate of its Future,  and a Request to the Carnegie Corporation  for a Grant to continue its work to 1943.  This review is not a compete report. The report will follow after January 1, 1942.  In the spring of 1940 a group of people who were concerned about the deeterious effect of haphazard explansion and i-considered restorations organized themseves into a committee to study the need for practical preservation and planned  growth of Charleston. The membership is now: [origina members are indicated by an asterisk]  Homer M. place, Vice-President South-Carolina Power Co., member State planning Board, Chairman  E. Miby Burton, Director of the Charleston Museum  John Mead Howes, F.A.I.A, author  Frederick H. McDonad, planning engineer, author, member County Zoning Committee  William M. Means, real estate agent, member City Board of architectural Review  James O\"Hear, business man, member origina committee to plan City Zoning Ordinance  Sidney J. Rittenberg, awyer, member of City Counci, member Zoning Commission  Albert Simons, F.A.I.A, author, member Board of architectural Review  Miss Alice R. Huger Smith, artist, author, historian  Samuel G. Stoney, architect, author, historian  J. I. Waring, doctor  Robert N. S. Whitelaw, director of theCarolina Art  Association  Miss Helen G. McCormack secretory of tho Committee  Two grants have been made to the Carolina Art  Association for the work of the Committee: [1] on December 27, 1939, $600 for the services of Mr. Frederick aw Olmstead, and [2] on May 13, 1940, $2,500. for the services of secretaria and research assistance for one year. The atter grant terminated on May 13, 1941, but Miss Helen G. McCormack, former director of the Vaentine Museum of Richmond, Virginia, was engaged for the year 1941.  Suggestions for procedure grew out of the consutations with and report of Mr. Olmstead. Two needs were obvious:  [1] an inventory of the whole city  to determine the buiding\n\n[End Page 1]\n2.  worthy of preservation, and [2] a central body which would act as a cearing house for information, would set standards of architectural excellence, and  would direct activities and make plans for preservation. As  a first step toward the achievement of these ends tha committee asked for and obtained a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to make the inventory and to take measures to estabish itself as the central agency.  On January 1, 1941, the Charleston regional planning Committee began the architectural survey which is the basis of its studies, the findings are recorded upon cards, which carry photographs of buildings and facts concerning use, condition, period, source of interest, value, history and bibiography. The cards are reviewed by three architects and an historian on the Committee. Cards have been mads for 338 dweings in the area designated as \"Od and Historic\" by the Zoning Ordinance, 465 dweings in other sections of the city, 36 churches, 25 Public buildings, 11 industrial and 95 commercial buildings. In addition to the buildings cards, 45 parks, cemeteries, groups and vistas have been recorded. This last cassification will be greaty explanded. A buildings are not considered of equa value, but are rated in five degrees of importance. Since the rating Is not compete it is impossibe to give the final score, but the proportions so far are 1 Nationally important buiding to 4 valuable to the city, to 8 vauable, to 9 notable, to I2 mentionable. When the buildings are rated they are located by coor symbos upon a map. In addition to the cord cataogue of architecture a small ibrary on planning is being assembed, and facts reating to the city\"s cultural and welfare obigations, and its economic background. In short, the Committee is trying to measure the cty\"s capacity to preserve its inheritance and its need of a more suitable pattern for wholesome contemporarary life. The Defense effort here, as esewhere, shows up the weak spots in our hitherto unplanned growth. should not the present effor to improve living conditions to meet the immediate emergency be combined with a definite program for the future?   No just estimate of the Committee\"s work can be made at the end of a first year of study end activity. Exceent surveys have been made before in Charleston and preservation movements, enthusiasticay started, hare faen short of their goa [and ours] because they acked the continuous support of a stable organization and the interest of an informed Public. the Carolina Art  Association which gave the impetus for the organzation of the Committee is wiing to accept the responsibiity of sponsorship and the Committee has recenty voted\n\n[End Page 2]\nthat it become formay a part of the Art  Association with the tite of Civic Arts Committee. However, its present budget does not permit the empoyment of the necessary secretaria and research assistance for the Committee of devoted vounteers. without the supporting organization the education of the Public cannot be accompished or its interest obtained. Therefore, in its eary stages, the Art  Association must seek hep to found the Committee\"s activities upon a sef-supporting basis.  When the Inventory is competed, the Committee is planning to announce its findings in the form of an exhibition. The exhibition is scheduled at the Art Associaltion\"s Gibbes Art Gallery late in December, and to continue into the first months of 1942. The exhibition will show by means of facts and photographs the number and importance of the buildings worthy of protection, and those threatened with loss by diapidation and demoition, end will show the need for a program of preservation. Moreover, it will recognize the achievements already made in the cause of preservation, from the Federal government\"s participation in saving two rice mis as Coast Guard and Nava Patro Stations to the accompishments of individuals who hove carefully restored shops and singe houses.   The Committee reaizes that its work will never be  propery achieved until it is supported ocay; however, there are two reasons why this has not been accompished and cannot be now: [1] it eected to spend its first year with no Publicity or Public mention in order to conduct its study without interference, and [2] present conditions have essened our norma sources of support. New sources are here but they are controed by the very eement which the Committee plans to reach with its educationa programs during 1942. The fact that  2,500 housing units have been added in the Charleston area by Federal Agencies in the past year aone and that the Navy Yard\"s present 10,000 workers are to be increased to 27,000 by 1947, indicates the need for the Committee\"s work and at the same time a potential source of support. Other industries are also  explanding.  We appy for a renewa of the last grant of $2,500.  We would ike to cite the Dock Street Theatre which is under the management of the Carolina Art  Association  as an indication of our ability to continue work after it has  been propery started. The Rockefeller Foundation made grants totaing $22,500. over a three year period to the theatre. These grants were concuded last spring but we then raised a fund of $30,000. from individuals to repace them.  The following materia is a copy of an artice  written for the Journa of the Society of architectural Historians. It enlarges on some of the materia above.  Robert N. S. Whitelaw, Director  Carolina ART  Association  December 4, 1941 \n\n[End Page 3]"
