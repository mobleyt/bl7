      "value": "Charleston 8th Nov 1817 My dear Mother, I receiv'd your letter of the 1st Nov. yesterday, and was glad to hear that the sick were recovering, though it really appears that as fast as they recover, those that are well get sick.- I had no idea that Caroline had been so sick, her constitution I am afraid is very delicate, too much so for this dreadful climate that we live in, I begin to feel uneasy about Mr. Heyward who has been in the Country now ten days, and several gentleman have had the fever and ague in consequence of visiting their plantations too early, that only went a week or two before he did, and as we have had no frost yet, the same danger exists now, that did a month ago, however I hope for the best, though I cannot approve of this plan of going into the Country on a certain day whether there is a frost or not.- I am afraid this warm weather is still detaining you at Bay-point, you really must be anxious to see your comfortable home [End Page 1] again, and be in peace and quietness, though it will be a long time before any of us can enjoy the happiness that we once felt, for even if all of us have not to mourn the loss of a beloved Husband or Child, still our hearts must bleed at the idea of what some of our nearest and dearest connexions are suffering. I suspect you will meet Brother William and Sarah in Beaufort on your return, Mrs. Dawson who has return'd says that Sarah has quite recover'd her health and looks well but has not grown very fat as we heard, - Mrs. Griffin left me the day before yesterday, so that I have not had an opportunity of delivering your message, but shall certainly do so as soon as possible, as it will be a great object to her to get the place at Mrs. Elliotts. I am getting well I believe, but I was never so weak at the end of my month before, I suspect to owing to the quantity of milk I have had, which is now lessening very much. The Child is very fat, and though he has outgrown the likeness to Edward, his Temper is the very counterpart. you see I begin to abuse him already. -Nat did not wish to give up his Nurse at all, but he is tolerably quiet now with my new maid Nelly, who [End Page 2] will mind him until we are able to suit ourselves with another Nurse. I was very much alarmed at receiving a message from Mrs. Matthews last Monday saying that she had just had a letter from Brother Edward informing them that Sister was extremely ill, and begging Mrs. M. to go to them as soon as possible as Sister was very anxious to see her, it distressed me very much as you may suppose, and made me very anxious to receive a letter from you, but as you mention nothing of her illness, I am in hopes that she has recover'd [ink faded] Mrs. Mathews word so, who is very anxious to hear from them. I will try and procure every thing that you have written for and if Bythewood does not arrive before we go into the Country I will leave the Boxes with my Mother who will send them for me. Do dear Mother remember me affectionately to all my Sisters and friends, and believe me to be ever your Affectionate child Hetty B Heyward P.S. I will send your letter to Mrs. Finley to day. [End Page 3] Marion begs me to tell you howdie for her, and begs you if you should be in Beaufort to send her children word that she is quite well and that they must write to her by Bythewood. Mrs. Mary Barnwell Beaufort South Carolina We have just heard that Joseph has been extremely ill at the Northward, but is now on the recovery. - I expect Mr. H. tomorrow [End Page 4]"
