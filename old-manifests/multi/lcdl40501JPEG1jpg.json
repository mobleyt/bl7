      "value": "(Excerpt from Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, Vol. II, Samuel Lewis, 1837) LUSK - site of a monastery over which St. Macculina, styled indifferently abbot or bishop, presided till his death in 497. In 825 the abbey was plundered and destroyed, in 854 it was burned together with the whole town; inso in 1069; in 1135 the town and abbey were burned and the Country of Fingal was wasted by Doenl MacMurrogh O’Melaghlin in revenge for the murder of Brod Conor, Prince of Meath. In 1190 a nunnary for sisters of Aroasian Order (was established[)?] following the rule of St. Augustine; it was confirmed by Pope Celestine in 1196. The church, built on the site and partly with the materials of the ancient abbey, is in the later English style of architecture, with a massive square embattled tower having at three of the angles a slender circular tower, and at the fourth, a similar tower of larger dimensions, which is roofless and without battlements. The interior consists of two long aisles separated by a series of seven pointed arches, now filled up with masonry. The eastern portion of the south aisle is the only part appropriated to divine service; the windows of the remaining portions are nearly closed up, and the whole of the north aisle is almost in total darkness. There are numerious sepulchral monuments, some of which are very ancient and highly interesting; of these, one of various kinds of marble, in front of the altar on the south aisle, was erected about the close of the sixteenth century to Sir Christopher Barnewall and his lady, whose effigies in a recumbent posture are well sculptured and elaborately ornamented. In the north aisle is a monument of black marble to James Beringham of Ballogh, Esq., bearing his recumbent effigy in chain armor. * * * * * * * (excerpt from Handbook for Travellers, James Fraser, Dublin, 1849) “LUSK....3 miles from Swords...the poor village of Lusk, adjoining which is the ancient church and round tower of that name. The former supposed to have been erected on the site of an ancient abbey possesses some architectural features of a very unusual character. It consists of 2 long aisles divided by a range of arches, the east end of one of the aisles having been fitted up for the parish church. At the present the whole building is in a state of sad dilapidation, but the part used as the church is about to undergo a thorough repair. On the floor of this (part) of the building is the fine monument of Sir Charles (??) Barnwall; and there are also several tombs in this and in the other parts of the church. At the west end is an ancient square tower beneath which is a crypt. The three angles of the towers are flanked by small attached round towers; close to the fourth angle, but detached, is one of the ancient round towers, the while forming a very remarkable group.” * * * * * * * * * (Excerpt from Shell Guide to Ireland, London, 1962) LUSK, County Dublin, village on Dublin-Drogheda road... Bishop St. Cuindid alias MacCuilinn (d. 497) founded a monastery here. When he died, he was buried in a cave (lusca) from which the place takes its name. The monastery[End Page 1] 2. suffered severely from the Vikings. The last recorded bishop (Aibill) died in 965; he was also Bishop of Swords. After the Angle-Norman invation, the monastery and its possessions were granted to St. Mary’s Abbey, Dublin. There was also an Augustinian Nunnary, which Archbishop Comyn transferred to Grace Dieu in 1190. The Protestant parish church (1847) and churchyard occupy portions of the site of St. MacCuilinn’s Monastery, of which the only surviving relic is the round tower (National Monument) to which has been attached the square tower of a medieval church demolished in the nineteenth century. In the medieval tower are housed the effigy tombs of James Bermingham of Ballogh (died 1527) and of Sir Christopher Barnewall of Turvey and his wife, Marion Sharl. The Bermingham effigy is one of the few sixteenth century armoured effigies of the English Pale, and the only one with Irish-style harness. The Barnewall tomb, erected in 1589, is an elaborate Renaissance piece of Italian (?) and Kilkeany marble. It was erected by Dame Marion Sharl and her second husband, Sir Lucas Dillon of Moynet. Also worthy of notice are the tombs of William Archdall of Dublin (died 1751) and of Sir Robert [Echlin?] of Rush (d. 1757)...At the east end of the townland, to the north of the road leading west from the protestant church, is the traditional site of an ancient monastery. IN a garden at the south end of the village is St. MacCuilinn’s Well, with a stone on which are the “imprints of the Saints’ knees>’ TURVEY HOUSE - 1 mile WNW of Donabate (near. Malahide) - Georgian successor of one built in 1565 by Sir Christopher Barnewall with materials from the Augustinian nunnary of Grace Dieu. Two miles ESE of Ballhoghill is Grace Dieu, site of one of the most famous nunneries of the English Pale. At the Dissolution the English colony in Ireland pled in vain for the convent on the grounds that there “the womankind of the most part of the whole Englishry of this land be brought up in ...learning and in the English tongue and behavior.” The convent and its possessions were granted to the Barnewalls, who dismantled the buildings in 1565 to provide materials for Turvey House, Donabate..... (Notes taken in Dublin, November, 1964, by Polly Barnwell, Dayton, Ohio) (Note: some of this was written in shorthand, so I may have misinterpreted a word or two of my notes, but it is correct in general, I think.
