In 1945-the civic services, committee, of the Carolina Art .associaltion ended a two-year \"\"..-study\"- of  traffic and parking- in the ower;  King, street area and. handed over\"  to., Council compete, .plans for off  street parking ots.  Part of the recommendations already have been put into operation  by., private, enterprise and are  manlifest - in , several parking  lots  on side streets just off - King,  The study .was, made .of the\"  bocks, bounded by Calhoun, St,  Phiip, Queen and Meeting streets.\"  Bocks from Society to Market on  the least side of King were excepted  from\"theieport  The,,,art associaltion\"s.-, plans in  euded detaied-, provisions, a suggested \". enabing - aw,\" \" estimate of  -the- costqf the -project,- and ,aA  estimated amortization of the .debt.  generaly, the plan caed -for.  .estabishment .of parking areas  through the: center of ,-bocks .with  provisions made for deivery and  refuse\" pick-up\" from the rear , of\"  King street stores. \"\"  The plan contempated\" no. parking in.Kmg\"street\".except for trucks  in ocations where\" no rear entrances, to stores are avaiable.  In the survey, the art  Association  found that , there- was sufficient  property avaiable\"to make ;a series,  of . inking parking.\" lots through  bocks on both .sides of King from  Calhoun to Queen\" street with .the  .exception\" \"of \"\"the, S.lociefy-Market  street area least of King,,  That; exception -was made\" because, the associaltion, found that the  cost of. property:,Afas; too high to ,be-  iircuded,, in the prbppsa\",  Otherwise, the associaltion\"  recommendations showed that most  of, the area was sum.and, could,  in 1945, be purchased at a resason-  :.able price. Sum clearance value  was also pointed.Up.  The committee also found that  the city owned several , pieces of  property in ;the center bock areas.  There was a question at the time  of  whether the city;. should, enter  the, parking ot business. City counci, apparenty felt the project was  not withinv-it\"s; scope,\"-but a Public  opinion po, by the:  Association of  501 residents in various parts of  the city showed, 417 believed\" the  city should take, over the project\",  and \"49\"\"fet it should be done by  : business. \"Thirty,-five did not, answer.     :\" ?,\",\"\"-\"    \"  More than , 1,000 persons worked  on the survey,;durng.the two.years,  It was presented; to the counci,  compete, with engine A\"ing, drawings\" showing, .avaiable   property   P 30\"  and estimates .of. the sae cost of  the property..  Prices, today are\" higher,, but the  1945 off-street parking survey, estimated the\"project cost at $1,235,-  723.  It was .estimated to. provide 1,065  parking spaces for some 5,000. to  7;000\" cars day \" .where , ,547 curb  parking, spaces were . avaiable in  that year. The project would be  ighted;.for safety \"and protection-at  night...  \": Revenue would come from parking meters Which would yied an  estimated $79,800, pus an estimated  $10,000 from, fines   annuay.  Maintenance and operation was  figured at $14,600 a year.  Om the basis of those estimates,  a $1,300,000 bond issue; was contempated. The  Association set up  ia table \" showing amortization  of  ;the-.debt of,one and one-haf per  cent, \"  25-year seria bonds. That  was . based, on estimated.. $65,200  revenue from parking meters ony,  . Robert ,,\"N, S, VWhitelaw, executive  director- of the Carolina Art  Association said the plan was presented  to the city by: the  Association \"with  no personal interest of \"-\"any individual- group - and, acting soey  inAhe, Public .-benefit\",. ,\"  2; He said the CAA would be  peased to cooperate with anyone  interested in studying; the survey."
