      "value": "Hardeeville June 10th 1863    Mr Jas B Heyward  Dr Sir  The old adage is in times of Peace prepare for war But in this case I reverse it We are enveloped in a most distructive dreadfull war without any reasonable knowledge of the end yet while there is life there is hope It becomes me a poor man with a family to be up and doing I would be a disgrace to my [family?] and [reticent?] to my duty if I sat idly and saw an opportunity pass that would be advantageous to their future welfare without improving it I have heard it supposed and perhaps it was spoken by one that knew that the mill at Black Creek would be abandoned by one or all the employers and in that event I would be thrown out of employment Should I out live the war I have done business for you at the mill And I would be pleased to Serve you in a different capacity Should you see fit to employ an inexperienced man as overseer at your Myrtle Grove Plantation I would be truly grateful to you for the situation I do not ask you to entrust the business to me alone Mr Evan T. Jones. who manages for Mr Chas Heyward has promised to give me all nessessary instructions in the matter Besides he is very convenient when on Combahee having to pass through a part of the business daily in attending to his Besides he feels an interest in me and would do anything in his power to set me up in business and take all responsibility I would promise most faithfully to do my whole duty both to you as my employer and to him as a friend and instructor as far as I am capable  [End Page 1] Will you not try me for one year  You cannot loose I wont responsible therefore cannot injure you while Mr Jones is fully capable as a planter I pledge my word and reputation as an honest man to follow directions strictly and faithfully I have no experience as a rice planter having had no opportunity to learn but have a little knowledge in the management of negroes Stock and planting provisions For the truth and to establish what I have said with regard to Mr E T Jones I refer you to him Gadsden PO Care Mr E Barnwell Heyward I tried to do my duty at the mill I was always there nothing suffered from negligence If I did anything wrong it was from ignorance I assure you no one alive tries harder to do what is right than I do which I hope you will give me an opportunity to prove The Mill at Black Creek is a pleasant place to live and healthy which it desirable But on the other There are three employers each having negroes which is the reason the same management does not suit all which makes it in some respects disagreeable Furthermore willing is a small business and unprofitable in this part of the country It gives a man no chance to gain a reputation to better or more profitable business I hope I have not annoyed you Please let me hear from you as soon as convenient If my appeal meets with favour I will be spared much uneasiness for the future of my life I feel dissatisfied at the idea of being out of business A situation such as that would be: would be greatly appreciated by me Please direct your letter to Blue House Care S H [illegible] With my best wishes for the health and safety of yourself and family during the war I Remain Very Respectfully  A M Jones [End Page 2]"
