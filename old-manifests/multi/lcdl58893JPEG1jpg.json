Tho Pews letter will appear within a week after each meeting.  It was reported that the service on Jnter-Tp.cia Sunday had been very we  rttended. The principal address was riven by . iss The\"a Stevenr,, of the \"\"omen\"s  Division of Christian Service of the ?.ethodist Church. She also ed the seminars  on three succeeding evenings, with an average attendance of fifty, fs a result  there has been renewed interest in inter-racia and s nuwber of new members  for the Coit-\"ittee. Twenty-nine nerbers attended thearch meeting  The resoution refardin? i\"epro Schoos of Charleston City end County .passed  by the omen of St. ivichp.e\"s ttniscopa Church, on fcarch 11th. was reported. The  e i  ;ome amp;t;  tding .  tnese things. Faiure to do so ma,y cause others to doubt the sincerity of our  fp.ith. The ord reouires justice of us.\"  The resoution reports on the existing conditions in the schoos of  Charleston County [incuding the city] thus:  \"Enro  .eat in idemente.ry Schoos       .   \"hite,7,P90     Negro,11,002  Enro-.ant in T ip-h Schoos 2,324 1,225  Tota enroment in a schoos 11,714 12,257  Fropert} value, A Schoos,-2,12,51 72P.P.75  Tota number of Tirh Schoos 10 2  Annue cost per pupi in average daiy attendance $9171 ;23.5\"  The cost r]er pupi in the \"egro Schoos is approximatey 1 4 of that in the  hite Schoos.  The vpue of V.esro  School nroperty is approximatey  5 that of  hite School property,.\" \"ach of the three eementary Wegro Schoos in Che reston  city has a tripe session to scenrmodate the number of pupis.  Stating their beief in eaua facilities and opportunity for ni groups  ropardess cf creed and coor, the \"Vomen of St. Michae\"s Church resoved that  a committee be appointed to confer with those in authority for correction of  the deporable conditions described; that copies of the statement and resoution  be sent to the Stpte and County egisative groups, the press, and others in  positions of infuence; and finay that other groups in the city and county join  with them in seeking to reoedy an unfair condition.  Poov.ing the report, the Inter-Racia Coooittee went on record as endorsing the resoution of the \" o en of St. Michae\"s pnd joining with then  in the endeavor to accompish their aims.    specific example of the critica situation in the schoos was given in  a report on Burke Schoo, the only high School for  -egro children in Chpreston  Count.,\", excepting eing ounior High in Jt. Peesant. Eurico\", said the report ,  :,is a food example of doing a fine job vith too itte of everything - too  itte desk room, too itte buiding space, too itte equipment, pnd not even  enough books.\"2 Attempts were xoade to ameiorate the crowded conditions existing  et urke sooe years ago by erecting temporary structures but even these are now  inadequate and ere in p deporable strte of disrepair.  The main tuidinc.,  erected in 1910, is also in poor condition.  Burke is not a South Carolina accredited high schoo, but not through eek  of educationa preparation on the part of its facuty.  The principal has the  best training the nation provides, is doinp: his Test, and wecome? the chance to  show his School to interested members of progressive groups. The teachers, in  spite of saary discreplancies, have the preparation required by accredited schoos.  The School could easiy be accredited by doinr three thingsi providing enough  books, enough science equipment, and \"\"ore cass-roc;\" space.  The last is the most  immediate probem.  The expected increase this fall is 200, or 200  more than  will be graduated in tune.  It will be physically impossibe to take care of  this increase unless somethinr. is done by September. Something can he done for  roughy o 10,000.  An adequate addition ike the o.Y. . vnney.  buit in 194.amp;gt; which  was constructed without use of any priority materias [excepting pumbing and  windot\". hardware] would sove the problem for a, few years at east.  ii fact-finding co. ittee ofo appointed to report further on schoos and  playgrounds.
