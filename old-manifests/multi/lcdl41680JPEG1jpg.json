      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent. Columbia. S. C. March 2nd [1860?] My dearest Brother. I am sorry to learn through your hurried letters that you were indisposed & obliged to travel-- I hope the Archbishop will soon feel much better. It was quite a relief to me when I found you did not contemplate bringing him up to Columbia. I would of course feel complimented to in forming the acquaintance of so great a man, & one whom every one must admire yet I hate meeting dignitaries. You will be glad to learn my dearest Brother that Mrs [Gaffney?] is here, & has paid us in full-- consequently [written on side of page:] I hope Anna told you that all are quite well Francis & all-- [End Page 1] we have in Bank $1400.00 for which we feel truly grateful, since I trust we will be able to manage without calling on you, & in the mean time, you know how happy we will be to accommodate you with the use of any--. I Wrote to you in great haste to Baltimore because I wished to answer a letter I received from Messrs Kelly Hedian & Piet, saying they had just learned we had the copyright of the Ursuline Manual, & wished to dispose of it-- & as they were anxious to publish some good Prayer Book & had as yet not fixed on any-- consequently could give all this attention to it-- Please instruct me as to what would be the proper arrangements to make &c--. Today I received a letter from Murphy & c declining the purchase of the copyright of the Ursuline Manual which I had offered him hoping to pay in that way for some of our Books-- therefore I will write to the editors of the Baltimore [illegible], & accept their proposal, if we can agree[End Page 2] about the money arrangements, but I look to you for instruction--. I feel disposed to enclose Fran [Wevers?] letters to you-- she has been forced by her mother to attend the Protestant Church since she went home, & has I think her Faith tampered with, & her desire to become a Nun abused-- I went to her, offering to receive her as a boarder for the sum of $100. per annum which inducement I offered for the preservation of her Faith-- I told her so-- She thanks me for the offer, but says her father is unable to give her more & she is unwilling to take it from her younger sisters and brothers-- But wishes me to tell her who she must write to, & obtain permission to enter the Convent-- she feels that she must incur her Mothers displeasure whenever she does that, & I think wishes to do so at once-- which I am not sorry for. I will tell her to write to you-- she told me her Mother preferred you to any Catholic clergyman she had ever seen--. John & myself[End Page 3] feel most obliged to you for the fish, but must beg you not to send us any more-- it is a losing business-- we never could consume such a quantity it spoils on our hands-- we have tried to dispose of some of it, but without success-- so between the freight, the quantity-- & last tho not least your part of the trouble-- I think it just as well to get all that we want in Columbia, unless [once?] in a way. We are preparing for Sr Mary's reception on Sunday evening the 25th of March, If you can manage to be here-- which I hope you can-- I will give the Choir up in toto to the children-- & try to make it all as impressive as possible, & have it public-- letting Fr. OConnell give it out in Church & we invite the friends of the Convent [;?] Let Me Know in time please, if you can come I will await your instructions on all the contents of this letter-- We all write in grateful respects [by?] your benediction. Present to his Grace all respects etc--. Please pray for you own sister Ellen Sr Baptiste--[End Page 4]"
