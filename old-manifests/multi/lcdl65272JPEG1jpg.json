  "description": "Postcard with a black-and-white photographic portrait of Ruth Alexandrovich. The postcard is pre-addressed to \"Procurator-General R. A. Rudenko\" and includes a printed message: \"24-year-old Ruth Alexandrovich was taken by the KGB on October 7, 1970--a week before her wedding date. Sensing impending arrest, she wrote, '...I shall never betray my much suffering people. I shall never betray my most cherished dream--to live, work and die in Israel.' Her fiance, Isay Averbuch, wrote, 'I am ready to testify that she has not committed a single violation of the laws.' Almost 40 other Jews, equally innocent of any violation of laws, are being kept in prison. Release the Jewish political prisoners.\"",
