      "value": "Charlestown, VA, Sept. 17th 1862 My Dear Mama, I write again in the hope that I may be able to get this to you. I am a little unwell, and left the Regt. yesterday at Harper's Ferry, to come here for a day or two. We took 1300 prisoners at Harper's Ferry, and a large amount of Government stores. It was fine to see the magnificent Regt. as they stacked their arms, and surrendered. Most of them have only been in the service for three months, and therefore were very full. Our Rgts. looked each, like one company beside them. Many of them were regular Down Easters, Vermont men. It is reported, but we do not know the certainty of it, that, Burnsides was captured yesterday with three thousand men. I think that I shall ride back to Winchester, it is only a little more than 20 miles from here. There[End Page 1] I can get off this letter, and get some rest. I wrote you two letters from Maryland. I do not suppose that they ever reached you though. This has been the most horrible life that you can imagine. I have now been [6?] weeks without a change of clothing. I have had no servant to wash for me, even if I had one. I find it impossible to hire a boy. As I told you in my last, which I suppose though, you did not get, once since we started I got Col. Jones's boy to wash my cloths for me, and remained without them, until they dried. The hardships of the life, I have become accustomed to, and can sleep on the ground, in the open air, as soundly, and comfortably, as on a bed of down, perhaps more so. But the filth makes me sick. There is scarcely a man in our Division of the Army, that is not covered with vermin, both officers, and privates. I have been thinking strongly of resigning, and joining the Marion Artillery. I know[End Page 2] they will not be sent out of So.Car. If I were to get into the condition of many around me, I would be obliged to do so, for I could not stand it; and it fact if this life lasts any longer, I do not see how we are to avoid it. One on a Generals staff, is in a totally different situation. In fact would like to ride through the country for pleasure in that way. They have a staff wagon along with them, which brings all their clothing, and they are at liberty to ride to any house, and get their meals, and a bath at any time. I do not see any chance of getting to a Hospital, as Uncle M. can do nothing for me. [Tary?] tells me that [Sam?] does not like Danville, and that he will be removed to some Hospital in So. Ca. or Ga. You see that I am writing on captured papers. I told you of the second battle of Manassas, in one of my letters. It was the most terrific of the war. It is impossible to conceive of a more dreadful looking field than the one of the[End Page 3] three days battle. There lay the wounded man by the decaying corpse, and there he had lain for three days. Many had propped themselves against trees, and dragged themselves as far as possible from their loathsome companions, and there died in those positions. I could not recognize some of our own men with whom, I was well acquainted. The woods, and fields for 3 or 4 miles were actually covered with the dead. In some places it was difficult to move about on horseback, without trampling on them. Lt. Monroe from Charleston, and Nat Heyward, were sitting under a tree, late in the evening talking together, after all the fighting was over, when a shell came, and completely crushed the heads of both. When will this dreadful war end? My coat is all in tatters, and I am such a ragamuffin looking fellow, that you would hardly know me. I am almost out of money, but there is a plenty owing to me, and if I could only get to some town, where there is a pay master, I could draw it. How I long to hear from you, and more still to see you. I look at your likeness whenever I get a chance, and carry it next my heart. Your Own Affectionate, W.[End Page 4] Soldier's Letter from W.W. Keith Asst. Surgeon 12th Regt. S.C.V. Mrs. P.T. Keith Anderson C.H. So. Ca.[End Envelope Text]"
