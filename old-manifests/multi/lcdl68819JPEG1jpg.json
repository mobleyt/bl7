Sidney Legendre U.S.N.R.\nP.O.166\nNay Yard - Pearl Harbor\nT. of HAWAII.\nMrs Sidney Legendre\n1528 31st Street N.W.\nWashington D.C.\nJan- 11 1943\nDear Sidney, \nI sent you my letter No 55 to-day so it will be interesting for you\nyou to see how long my No I.V. letter takes to reach you by comparison.\nTry writing me this way as the air mail has been discontinued and this will\nfill in the long lapses when we get no boat mail.\nI am enjoying your flowers my darling which arrive regularly every\nweek end.They are lovely,and such a delicious thought and bearer of your love.\nI am so happy Old Man Morris is picking up his health on Vitamin\npills.They may make his hair grow,and get him back on this tennis court with\nyou besides.\nI dream of those lovely beches, and blue sky,and long to be with \nyou splashing in the surf. Here the sun never shines and the ground is covered\nin ice and snow. You are so lucky,and I am so happy for you.\nLife goes on as usual on its round of office life which leaves\nlittle of interest to report to you in the way of amusement.\nI am over one of my colds, and the baby has escaped one all to-\ngether. Most people have\"flu,\" many are learning to use their legs and walk as\ncars may only be used to go to work with. I assure you that is one thing I\ndo not mind at all. I only wish I found time for more exercise,and could\njoin you at the outrigger club for a good burn and a long swim. I miss the\nair, exercise, trees and most of all of course you my darling. I live for the\nday of your return.\nMy boss is going away for good across the ocean and we shall miss\nhim so much. No one could be nicer to work for than David and I am truly\nsunk about it.\nTake care of yourself my darling and write me often. I live for your\nletters. Your last was no 46 received the sixth of Jan.\nPlease snd me some snap shots,I should love ot have some.\nEverything is fine here and going well, and I hope you and Morris\nare happy and well too. Write me all your news.\nGive Morris my love and tell him Nancy and I both sent flowers\nto Mr. Palmer's funeral for you both.\nAll my love as always- and a big hug and so many kisses.\nArmant arrives tomorrow and will telephone you.\nI hope your plans have not changed and that all is well with you.\nThe moon is full [ton]ight and I can picture how beautiful it\nmust be out in Hawaii shining on the cocoanut palms. How I would love to be\nthere beside you drinking in the soft night air and living it with you.\nGoodnight my darling-\nGertie"
