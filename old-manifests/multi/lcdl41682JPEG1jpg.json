      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent. Columbia. S.C. March 10th/60. My dearest Brother, I congratulate you the return of your birthday-- wish you a very happy one & many Joyous returns spent in God's holy service. I was not the only one who went to Holy Communion for you this morning, & of those who did not, many offered their fervent prayers--. I hope you have read my two last letters which I am anxious to get a reply to, about the editor of the Baltimore [Mission?] & our Copy-rights of the Ursuline Manual-- and of Miss [Wevers?], who I have recommended to consult you--. Now I have another advice to ask-- it is about a Miss[End Page 1] Gibbon, whose Father you know, & whose Sister you spoke of coming to us-- I was called to the Parlour to see Mrs Gibbon & Miss Gibbon who said they had seen you in Charleston not long since-- Miss Gibbon wishes to come with her younger sister, & study Latin-- she would like to be parlor boarder --what do you think of it? Please let me know for I promised to consider the subject & write to her-- Revd Father Birmingham told me I might expect to see you very soon, as you were offered to attend the Lancaster Court? soon-- we will pray for the success of your appearance there-- How is Archbp Hughes? We will give him a share in our [illegible] to St Joseph & a general [illegible] (as far as I am concerned it is on your account)-- but it would be amiable & expression of charity to mention it to him--, that is if you like. What about Sr Marys reception on the 25th. I hope you are quite well & will soon have the kindness to give me a reply to my three letters & Pray for us all, especially for your own Sister Ellen Sr Baptiste[End Page 2]"
