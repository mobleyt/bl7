I felt quite jealous when I heard your name was in the Papers to think I was not to see you but could not hear of you, and therefore perhaps you did not even know we were here or other matters took you up all I can say is I hope to see some or all of you during our stay which I fear will be until pretty late in February I direct this to Blue House presuming you are by this time settled there for the winter- I don't know how to think I may pay you a visit but I hope your long promised visit will be paid us this April as our new child and Nurse will not be at all amiss- We are quite well and hope you are all the same- Mr S writes in much love to all with you at your Uncle Charles and Nat   Yr Affc. Aunt M Smith [End Page 2]"
