      "value": "Carolina    ART     Association  GBBES    MEMORIA   ART    Gallery  Charleston    S    C  OCT    7  1942  House planning Bureau  Working unobtrusivey behind the scenes,  a planning committee set up by the Carolina  Art  Association has spent three years studying the physical makeup of the city of  Charleston.  Before the war thousands of tourists came  each year to see the old buildings and time-  meowed streets. Architecture was our  stock in trade, and the art associaltion, dedicated to promotion of a the arts, included  architecture among its interests. Its special planning committee therefore was  working with the primary aim of preserving  the things that made Charleston more than  just another city. A survey, conducted by  Miss Helen G. McCormack, under the committee\"s direction, showed that preservation,  to be effective, has to be functiona; that is,  we need to keep our old houses ivable,  rather than turn the streets into ong rows  of museums.  The art associaltion\"s work is so we recognized that the Rockefeller Foundation has  awarded a new grant to carry on the work  of the Civic Services committee, especiay  in ong-range city planning.  The war has superseded a other concerns,  including city planning. The art  Association  therefore has decided to make avaiable the  information it has accumuated and the facilities it possesses in an attempt to aeviate, in whatever way it can, the amost  intoerable housing shortage that exists in  Charleston.  Army and navy\" officers are streaming in  as wartime instaations develop. Soon the  airport will become a humming training  center, adding to the volume of personne.  Construction workers\" families are without  roofs over their heads. Worst of a, numbers of men who come here to the shipbuiding plants find living conditions impossibe and soon depart.  New construction of private homes is  rued out not only by ack of vacant space  within the city imits but by wartime shortage of materias and abor. The government will grant priorities, however, for remodeing existing homes to house war workers. Many people have the buildings and  the money to invest in improvements, but  are baffed \"by the difficuties of procedure.  The art associaltion\"s newy estabished  planning bureau will attempt first to determine the need for advisory services, and  then to set up whatever services are indicated. Some of the obvious needs arc advice on threading through the mazes of appications for oans and priorities. Incidentay, the bureau will attempt to carry out  the origina ong-range aim of the art associaltion, the preservation of Charlestons  character, which has persisted through fire,  storm, earthquake and wars.  Some day, this war will have to end.  Whether Charleston suffers from enemy  bombs or friendy saws and hammers, the  face of the old city inevitaby must be  changed somewhat. Through inteigent  planning now, we can avoid at least some of  the evis of sudden and i-considered construction.  NEWS a COURIER  Charleston. S, C"
