      "value": "Circular TO THE FRIENDS OF THE LORD'S DAY. The object of this communication is to secure the general attendance of Delegates from every section of our Country, at the National Lord's day Convention which, in pursuance of a previous call, is to be held in Baltimore on Wednesday, the 27th day of November next: and to invite the active cooperation of all the friends of the Sabbath in procuring the appointment and attendance of Delegates, and furnishing the Convention with the statistical information hereinafter called for. The proposition to hold such a Convention, originally suggested by the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, has been sanctioned by the Sabbath Convention of Maryland, Delaware and The District of Columbia; by the American and Foreign Sabbath Union, through their Secretary, Rev. Dr. Edwards ; by the State Conventions .of Pennsylvania and New York, and the Charleston Sabbath Association. A National Convention held under such circumstances, cannot, we are convinced, fail to exert a momentous influence, either favorable or unfavorable, upon the cause. If it shall be characterized by Numbers, Influence and Interest commensurate with the transcendent importance of the object for which it is to be convened, viz., The suppression, as far and as early as practicable, by moral influence, under the Divine blessing, of the profanation of God's holy day, throughout our land;â€”its beneficent effects will be felt not only by the present, but by all future generations. We confidently hope that in all these respects, the character of the Convention will fully correspond with the magnitude of the in involved; and that it may be made truly national in its character, by the attendance of Delegates from every section, however remote, of our country. Let the distant cities and Districts send at least one Delegate to manifest their heartfelt co-operation and sympathy. Renewing, therefore, the invitation which had already been very extensively circulated, we invite all to attend: We invite Ministers of the gospel to lay this subject before their Congregations, and procure the appointment of large delegations : We invite the citizens of every Election District to assemble in primary capacity, and appoint delegates: We invite all merchants, professional men, agriculturists, manufacturers and mechanics, to attend personally, or send representatives. And lastly, Tho' not least, we cordially and earnestly invite officers and stock holders in canals, rail-roads, steamboats and stage-lines, forwarders, agents, clerks, conductors, boatmen, drivers and all others concerned in the carriage of persons or goods, or connected with the shipping interest, to attend and take part in the deliberations of the Convention. Let all come that the views, feelings and interests of none may he overlooked, and that the wants and welfare of all classes may be considered and promoted. With a view of collecting a mass of statistics full, exact and well-authenticated, to be systematically arranged and laid before the Convention when it assembles, we respectfully request the friends of the Sabbath to whom this Address shall come, to furnish us by a letter addressed to \"The Sabbath Association, Baltimore, Md.\" at as early a day as practicable, with exact answers to the following queries, viz., 1. What Railroads of Canals, stages or steamboat lines are in operation in the State or section of country in which you reside ? What is their extent? 2. Are they used upon the Sabbath for the carriage either of passengers or merchandize? 3. If so, what ratio does the Sabbath travel and transportation (hole) are to that of the other days of the week ? and what, are the relative receipts? 4. Is the transportation of the mail assigned as a prominent reason for the Sabbath use of any of these modes of conveyance'? 5. Do the proprietors deem their employment on the Sabbath to be profitable in a pecuniary view? 6. Are the proprietors willing or unwilling to discontinue Sunday travel on their lines? 7. What are the sentiments of those employed on these routes, touching the suspension of Sabbath labor? 8. Has the carriage either of passengers or merchandize on the Sabbath been discontinued on any of these routes ? If so, to what extent ? And what have been the consequences, 1st, in reference to the morals of those employed ; 2d, in reference to the pecuniary results? 9. What is the present state of public sentiment in your vicinity, in respect to the observance of the Lord's day, compared with that of former years? 10. Have any special efforts been made to promote its sanctification? and with what success ? [Delegates are requested, on their arrival, to report themselves at the Lecture room of the Fifth Presbyterian Church (Rev. Mr. Hanmer's,) in Hanover street, between Pratt and Lombard sts. ; where a Committee of Reception will be in waiting to secure them accommodations.] (CHAS. W.

On behalf of the Baltimore Sabbath Association, we respectfully invite yon to attend and participate in the proceedings of the above national Convention : and also to lend your influence as far as practicable in promoting the accomplishment of the objects detailed in the above Circular. Yours very respectfully, The Committee, of Correspondence.[End Page 1] To the Charleston Sabbath Association: Gentlemen: We write to solicit your association touching the National Lord's day Convention which has been called for November 27th next. Dr Edwards has kindly relieved us of the task of awakening the New England States. The Philadelphia Sabbath Association have taken charge of all the Northern States from New York to Missouri. We contemplate operating in the middle and some of the Western States and we have to request that you will be responsible for the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida. Those states are too distant from us to admit of our laboring to much advantage if any. We also respectfully request you to procure the services of Judge Berrien, and some other prominent gentleman from the South in preparing and submitting to the convention, an address to the directors & stockholders in Rail Roads on the Subject of the Sabbath - Dr. [Illegible] has [been?] written to concerning Canals; and an address to the people at large will be delivered by some eminent man from the West. We hope you will stir up the South effectively. We respectfully suggest, that it is desirable that some of the friends from the South should come on a few days prior to the convention to meet with others from the other sections and [illegible] [End Page 2] some systematic [plan?] of proceedings to be suggested to the convention - By order of the Baltimore Lord's day Association Yrs Very Respectfully [Chas?].
