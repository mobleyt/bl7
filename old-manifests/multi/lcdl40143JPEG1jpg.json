      "value": "Apl 8th 1838 My dear Brother I am very much dissatisfied with myself that I have suffered so much time to pass without writing to you. I avail myself therefore of the impulse given to my affection for you by a letter Sister Nancy has just received from you to write even if it be but a few lines. You are often in my thoughts and prayers and never thought of or prayed for without tenderness and strong love, yet I serve you as I do my master suffer love to glow and pass off and produce [nothing?]. Yet I [illegible] you [illegible] and him too unfaithful and unfruitful though I be and again and again compelled to appeal to him who knows my heart rather than show him the proofs in my life and conversation. I read lately a Review of [Coxe's?] Life of Fletcher and whilst deeply humbled and full of persistent sorrow, I thank God I was enabled to rejoice in the work of God's spirit and the exaltation of the crop of Christ and though from the dust to claim fellowship with this precious [saith?] of the Lord. My trials here are very great, the hardest of all is that I bear them and still I am often tempted to run away from them but when I think how little I have done or can do in return for all the blessings which God has bestowed upon me. I cling to the severest trial and rejoice that I am counted worth to [illegible] my [praise?]. [I?] do not know how it is with others but presence with me seems very [illegible] and I [am?] often obliged to struggle with [illegible][End Page 1] My connection with the College however is very loose for I am not the person for this station and as soon as the proper man appears, I shall feel the duty very easy which will call upon them to make room for him. Mr Thornwell has proved a very good choice and you were right in supposing that God would dispose of things much more wisely than we could. I am satisfied now that he has ordered this direction far better. Than if my wishes had been complied with. Mr T is a man of prayer and of very high order of mind. I trust that he will become a blessing to the College. Stephen and himself are on the best footing of confidence and cooperation. I am very glad to hear that you intend to pay a visit to the country not merely your bodily health requires it, but yr spiritual strength I trust will be renewed by calmness and peaceful communion with God through his creation. He who knows the [constitution?] of man gave him the rest of the Sabbath and [illegible] whom that day is not a day of rest must seek it at other seasons. I am very glad to learn that you have freed upon a House and that it is near yr Church. The Pastor ought if possible to live among his people, that temptations to neglect his pastoral duties may not assist him too strongly. You ask if I intend to travel this Summer. I have no such intention. I never have had and know not how such a report has arisen, except that Cousin Sally's family wished me to go. My health (I thank God) has been restored and there does not exist the least necessity for travelling. I am not much tempted by the pleasure of travelling and take no credit on that [illegible]. I am too fond of mere ease, to find pleasure when it costs labour. I do not know that I can give any very favorable [illegible] of the College. I do not myself perceive such improvement in the conduct or studiousness[End Page 2] of the young men as I had hoped to witness. I thank God however that there are many of them who gladly avail themselves of Stephen's religious instructions and attend his Bible Class regularly and prepare [themselves?] by a study of the Bible. Pray for us dear Brother that God would give us a refreshing from on high. We have not formed any plans for going down yet, Sister Nancy thinks of paying you a visit if she can arrange the matter conveniently but nothing has been settled. Our children are all well the Scarlet fever has been in Columbia and several children have died, but God has heretofore been so gracious that I trust is his goodness and refer myself to his wisdom. As I trust that the Good Shepherd will gather us all into one fold. I strive not to trouble myself much about the time or the order in which he may call us in. I must now close this rambling letter May God keep and bless you dear brother yr Affectionate Brother RW Barnwell[End Page 3] To The Revnd Wm. H. Barnwell Charleston So. Carolina[End Page 4]"
