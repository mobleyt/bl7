Dart & Spears [End Page 1] Pine Land   June 20th   My dear Mother   I suppose 'ere this you and my Father are comfortably settled for passing away the summer as usual- having disposed of the boys and Elizabeth at school, Ann to her french and Madame Labat, and Joseph studiously engaged in perusing all the books in the little library-thus do the days glide on serenely and uninterruptedly-   We have been fixed in our Pine Hut about ten days and the neighbours are following our example as fast as they can-The weather has been intensely hot for some days past. and no rain, tho' we have been frequently threatened- My crop of rice I have given over as lost, and shortly I fear shall be compelled to relinquish my hopes of making even provisions- 'tis a Melancholy drought, and my anticipations are  [End Page 2] very gloomy for next winter- Our health continues very good,- I am able to amuse myself in hunting fishing and drawing the Seine, and Susan's recreation is the ride out with me every afternoon in our new gig- and thus our days pass- Our neighbours are prevented from being as sociable as they were last summer, owing to the death of young McPherson and the unfortunate situation of Mrs. R Hutson, whose mental and bodily complaints are not improved- I received a few lines from Joseph by Susan's maid who came up in the Ann, enclosing an account of the Editor of the Federal republican, which he had settled- tell him I am very much obliged to him but beg he will do me two more favors- one of which is to call at the Courier office, and tell Mr. Willington that I have not received the F. R, for the last two years, and did not consider myself as a subscrib  [End Page 3] -or, when the term was up for which I had paid- and request he will inform the Editor of the F.R. of it, and beg he will not send me any more such bills, and to take my name off from the list of subscribers-- the other is to procure from Black a pair of shoes, tied at the sides like the pair he saw me with-- Black has my measure--   Susan joins me in most affectionate [illegible] to all, and desires me to say she will write to you both- at present there is no incident which could form the subject of a letter worth perusing- and for this reason I trust my dear Mother you will excuse the brevity of mine- but believe me   always your truly affectionate Son-   Wm M Heyward.
