  "description": "Romant de la Rose (or Roman de la Rose) tells the story of a lover who dreams of a beautiful rose kept captive in a castle. The allegorical poem was composed in medieval France at the height of the age of chivalry and courtly love by Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun. Beginning to write Roman de la Rose in the late 1230s, de Lorris left the work unfinished when he died ca. 1278. De Meun, also spelled de Meung, completed the lengthy work of poetry ca. 1270-80, building on the concept of courtly love while incorporating his own poetic style. In the story, the twenty-five-year-old narrator recounts in the first person a dreamed journey into a beautiful garden inhabited by D??duit (Pleasure) and his companions, Jeunesse (Youth), Richesse (Wealth), Liesse (Jubilation), and Beaut?? (Beauty). L'Amant (the Lover) went to select a rose blossom from the Fountain of Narcissus, when he was shot with several arrows by the God of Love, leaving him forever enamored of one specific flower. In the quest to pick the Rose (and conquer Love), the flower and its attendants represent the Lady and her sentiments while being wooed. Personified courtly ideals comprise the actors in the fable, which tells the adventures of the Lover who must avoid the traps of Male Bouche (Foul Mouth), Dangiers (Danger), and Jalousie (Jealousy) to win his lady, the Rose. Jean de Meun concludes the narrative with a bawdy account of the plucking of the Rose, achieved through deception, which is not consistent with Guillaume de Lorris' original idealized version of the quest for love. Around 300 manuscripts of the Roman de la Rose have been preserved around the world.",
