  "description": "Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis (Use of Paris), created circa 1460s, is an example of a Book of Hours, a personal prayer book. Notably popular in medieval Europe, a Book of Hours consisted of collections of Christian prayers created to assist its owner in prayer recitation at different times, or 'hours,' of the day. The manuscripts were written in Latin as it was the language of the medieval church. Intended for individual use at home, a Book of Hours was a simplified version of the daily prayers observed by members of the clergy and monastic orders. These books were often passed down through generations of a family as an heirloom. The high cost of commissioning such a work made a Book of Hours a source of pride in addition to being a source of devotion. Commissioned versions of these books were tailored to the particular requirements of its owner, varying in content, order, and level of decoration. Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis (Use of Paris) incorporates Morae de Sancta Cruce, Horae de Sanctu Spiritu, the Passion Sequences, the Stabat Mater, and other prayers. The illuminations in this Book of Hours (26 total) are believed to be the work of four artists; influences include Master of Jean Rolin II; the Bedford Master; and the styles associated with central France, southeastern France, and Besan??on regions. This work was rebound in the 18th century. Provenance information for this work includes Francois Cesar Le Tellier, the marquis of Courtanvaux (1718-1781). Other indications of the original patron are the presence of Arnulf of Tours as fourth in the litany of martyrs, and Claude of Besan??on in the memorials.",
