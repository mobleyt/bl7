      "value": "13\nSept. 30th '43\nDear Sidney,\nLast night I went to a concert at Albert Hall with\nAvie, Bobbie Strawbridge [and] Mary Marlborough . It was\na real \"sing fest.\" 200 American colored soldiers and\nRoland Hayes - when they sand the spirtuals-\n\"Deep River, \"I got a Sister Over There,\" \"The Lord\nis going to Lay his Cold Icy Hands on My.\"\n[and] \"I Want to Die Easy\", etc. etc. it\nwas really wonderful!! All those wonderful\nqueer low [and] high notes with breaks in\nthe middle,and a conductor that was\nlose jointed [and] so graceful it was fascinating.\nIt was right up my alley [and] you would\nhave loved it too. The 200 men evidently\nhad been told they could n't sway [and] tap\ntheir feet, but I assure you before the\nend of the program they were all\nfull of rythm, [and] swayed about as\nthey they were singing around the\nfire under the oaks at Medway -\nThey did n't want to stop at all\nwhen it was time for \"God Save the\nKing \"- That is really singing \nat its best for they did n't try anything\n[End Page 1]\n2\nhighbrow. I felt old Sam our tractor\nman might have been in the group\nbut I was too far away to recognize\nthe faces-\nThe hall was so draughty that although \nI had on a sweater , coat [and] over coat\nI could feel my cold increasing in\nleaps [and] bounds. We had supper after\nwards at Claridges as by this time it was\njust 9 P.M. The shows all start at 8.45 .\nIt is a good system I think because it gets\none to bed at a reasonable hour -\nThe \nThe streets are so black that even\nthe oldest inhabitant loses the way -\nI nearly always fall flat on my face\nwhere I get through the revolving doors.\nThe hotel is crouded all the time -\nHigh ranking officers jam the lobby -\nPeople come [and] go [and] there is fearful\nactivity every minute - I am sure\nwhen I finally get into my flat\nit will seem very peaceful [and] welcome.\nMary Marlborough is very smart in her dark\nblue uniform with gold shoulder boards.\nShe looks like an Admiral but is really\nhead of the Red Cross though out the country\ndistricts. Blendan [?] is filled with officers\n[End Page 2]\n3\n[and] she lives in one wing .\nThe streets are full of girls in uniform\n[and] I must say they are a grim looking\nlot - cotton stockings , low shoes, toting\nbrief cases , and looking terribly masculine.\nThe U.S. gals don't look too chic\neither . Think they picked a poor looking\nbunch to send over as I have n't seen\nany beauties - That goes for the Red Cross\ngals too. Clothes coupons are scarce\n- it takes a lot to buy anything - consequently\npeople look a little run down at the heel\nwhich is only natural. getting the war\nwon is the jobs - [and] that's all any body\ncares about - Believe me its a\nbetter atmosphere than Washington -\nhere every one works, [and] I see less\nsigns of \"power\" [and] \"promotions\" [and]\nmore real work [and] earnestness. People\nlook tired - may be a little stale =\nI don't wonder. as far as food [and] \nhealth goes it could [n't] be better . People\nare well fed [and] look more spry [and]\nkeen than they ever have [even the 'tired'] - I am\ntold country children have never has\nmore balanced diets.\nI hope you are getting my letters darling\n[and] that they won't take too long -\nLots of love my darling-\nYour- Gertie.\n[End Page 3]"
