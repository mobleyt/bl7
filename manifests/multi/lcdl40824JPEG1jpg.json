The Blue Hose has a lot of ground to cover.  Last season they lost ten games, won none.  The Citadel has played three games this season, failing to win any.  Both will be out for blood.       Two Charleston boys will be on the Presbyterian squad that invades Charleston.  They are Pete Holcombe and Huiett Paul.  Holcombe weighs [illegible: 185?] pounds, is six feet, two inches tall, is on the team for the third year, has won his letter twice, is 23 years of age.  Paul tips the scales at 150, is five feet, nine inches, has been on the team for two years, is 20 years of age.       Last year The Citadel won a [illegible: 19-0?] victory over the Blue Hose.

[newspaper article:] RIGHT FLANK IS JINX POST FOR CHARLESTON HIGH TEAM  Three Players Who Have Filled the Position Have Been Injured; Wilson Johnson Latest to Go on Shelf; Bantams Face Strong Camden Outfit Friday.       The right end position is a jinx post for the Bantams.       The third man to occupy that position has been injured and the season is just getting under way.  Coach Gene Clark said today that Wilson Johnson pulled the ligaments in his ankle, placing him on the shelf and opening the end gap for the third time this year.       The first man at the post was Fred Attaway.  He sprained his knee.  The second to essay the task was Frank Heidt.  He broke his hand.  The third mad to go to right end was Johnson.  He has pulled the ligaments in his ankle.       Coaches Clark and Ephie Seabrook have shifted Leroy Miller to the job and are hoping for the best.  Miller so far has suffered no injuries, and observers are hoping that he has broken the jinx."
