      "value": "Charlottesville, Virginia July 26, 1845 My dear wife, We arrived here yesterday afternoon at 7 o'clock, after a safe and pleasant journey, and have just returned from a very agreeable expedition to visit Monticello & the University of Virginia. I feel a great deal better, though the pain in my side has not yet left me entirely. Indeed I don't know that it is less than it was in Charleston though I feel a strong hope that the delightfully fresh air and the continual exercise I am taking will by the blessing of God remove it before long. I did not find it as cool here last night as I had expected, but during the day the air has been as pleasant as it could be. I expect to spend tomorrow (Sunday) here & leave about 4 o'clock Monday morning for the Warm Springs where I hope to breakfast on Tuesday Morning. There I shall probably remain until the 5th of August and then go on to the White Sulphur Springs after spending a day or two at the Hot Springs. Your letters after the the 1st of August should be directed to the White Sulphur Springs, Green-Brier County, Virginia. I hope to get a letter from you while I am at the \"Warm Springs,\" but shall not be disappointed if I do not as I believe I requested you before I left home to direct to the White Sulphur. I have found Robert a great comfort to me. He keeps the keys & tends to the baggage, but has not yet had an opportunity of putting things into as good order as could be wished. He seems to enjoy himself very much, & has heard & seen already enough to supply him with talk for a month. We have prayers [End Page 1] together in our chamber morning & evening, in which we never fail to remember you all at home. I have not yet called to see the Rev Mr. Meade the Episcopal Minister here. He is the son of Bishop Meade & is well spoken of. As soon as I get through writing & other matters, I think of calling upon him but I know from experience Saturday is such a bad day for a Minister to be interrupted that perhaps I will not call on him until the evening. Of course, I do not mean to preach tomorrow, but if the doctor had been in the stage yesterday afternoon, & seen how much I exerted my lungs in a discussion on the Tariff with a Northern Manufacturer he would have said I had much better preach a sermon than do that. I hope however, I shall be more on my guard in future & not only for health sake, but for higher considerations, avoid all such similar disputations, which though conducted in great good temper do not perhaps reflect my great credit upon a Minister of the Gospel. The Roads & Stages & [fare?] in Virginia are far better than I had expected. Indeed I have been highly gratified with the Country & the People thus far. I know few places which have pleased me more altogether than the scenery around this village. The view from Monticello is, I think the finest I have ever seen. I felt as if I could have spent a month there. I do not wonder at the retirement of Mr. Jefferson who had so lovely and yet grand a place to live at. Every thing is however going to decay. The house which is a noble one is entirely out of order. It was purchased by Capt. Levy of the Navy a Jew who is very seldom there, & stragglers visiting the place have done so much damage, that he has locked the gate [End Page 2] as well as the house & we had to walk about a mile up the mountain after we had tied our horse at the gate before we could reach the house & then we could only walk around it & examine it. Robert picked a green peach from a tree that is growing on the Portico in front of the house & we got several other things for Martha who seems to be the only one of the family who has a taste for curiosities. The University of Virginia is beautifully arranged. Nothing can be neater, & more tasteful. The Rooms for the Students are quite too small. One of the professors came up & spoke to us, & carried us into the Library & gave us a good deal of information reflecting the Institution, but none of the students & only a few of the Professors were there, as it is at present vacation. I wish very much to visit Weyers Cave one of the curiosities of Virginia, but don't know whether I shall be able to get there very conveniently. I bought in Richmond a book which we find of great service, & which will give Robert a better idea of Virginia than he has of South Carolina. It is called \"Historical Collections\" of Virginia by a Mr. Howe & contains 100 illustrations and a history of all of the counties in the state, with a brief biography of the leading men born in them &c. It is chiefly a compilation but is quite interesting & will do Robert, I hope much service so far as information is concerned. I got a [illegible] jacket for him at Richmond & 3 pr of stockings, very cheap, & [illegible] good so that he is well enough supplied with clothes. He is to write you a whole letter by himself today, & I dare say he will tell you all about himself. It seems as if I had been from home a month, & it is only 5 days. [End Page 3] I don't see how it will be possible for me to remain away two months. I propose to return by the way of Buncombe & Greenville, & will probably go to the Glen Springs, & the other places in our own State, if it be not too late, or perhaps may return through Georgia & [MS damaged] Stephen a visit at Mont-pelier. <CHARLOTTESVILLE VA JUL 26> Mrs. W.H. Barnwell Charleston So. Ca. If my hand writing is very bad you must make allowances. I am writing on a wash-stand. I hope to write to you again on Tuesday afternoon from the Warm Springs. Kiss the children for me. I may write each of them a few lines in one of the sheets of Robert[']s letter. It is to be on a thin paper just come out of which two sheets go for simple postage. God be with you. Your affectionate husband. W.H. Barnwell [End Page 4]"
