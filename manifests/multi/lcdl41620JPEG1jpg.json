      "value": "Galveston February 24 1859 Right Revd Sir I have never yet offered you my congratulations at your elevation to a situation which to yourself brings solicitude and anxiety but at the same time fills the hearts of all your friends with delight and confidence at the anticipation of the good that we feel assured will accrue to our beloved Diocese under your fostering care. You will not I am certain say or think that your old friend had become a flatterer when she tells you that your accession to the high position you under Good Providence now occupy has been to her a source of heartfelt pride and satisfaction. You will believe this I know without further assurance from myself. My friend Mrs. Simmons will present you this-she is anxious for an in- [End Page 1] troduction to you. This lady is a native of Charleston, but has resided for many years in Texas-She was formerly a member of the Episcopal Church-but about two years ago became a convert to our Holy Religion.-Her daughter who accompanied her is I believe also a Catholic and has been for some time a pupil and boarder at the Ursuline Convent in our Island City.-I am much attached to this lady and have have known her intimately for several years, and it is with great regret that I part with her perhaps forever. She will probably make Charleston her permanent residence, as she has an aged mother to whose comfort she wishes to devote herself.- Will you not sometimes Revd Sir give a kind remembrance and a prayer and even a short letter to your old friend? And present me most respectfully to Revd Dr Baker to [End Page 2] Father Sullivan Dr Cocoran and last tho' not least in my veneration and respect to dear Father ONeil- I received not long since a joint letter from my dear Grand Child Ellen-and from you Sister Ellen.- and I feel a very strong inclination to take this coming summer a peek at some of my dear friends in S Carolina-and pay my own dear child illegible a visit in the old North State.- You must Revd Sir excuse this illegible communication, old times and old feelings come back to an aged woman. You come before my minds eye as you were at the moment you left Charleston for Rome, the recollection of our lamented Bishop England, his last moments, so full of love for his flock and of resignation fills my heart at this moment and then his successor to whom I and my children and grandchildren owe a debt of gratitude never to be forgotten, all [End Page 3] those thoughts crowd into my mind at one and the same moment, and the remembrance of the hallowed and venerated dead renders me in some degree oblivious of the respect I ought to show to their successor you will I am sure pardon me if I have forgotten for an instant that you are now Bishop and remember you only as the favored pupil of one and the friend of both those sainted men.- And now I will close this which when I began I intended for a mere letter of introduction.-and request you to receive the Right Revd and dear Sir the assurance of the high respect and esteem of your friend. Eleanor Spann Apr 1859 Mrs E Spann Galveston Tex. [End Page 4]"
