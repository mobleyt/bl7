      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent Columbia S.C. Aug 7th/59 My dearest Brother I hasten to let you know that we cannot have our ceremonies of reception and Profession as we wished, at the close of the retreat, but are obliged to postpone it until the feast of St Augustine, on the Decollation of St J Baptiste. Father Joseph is very satisfactory and giving us an excellent retreat. It is really exciting to see our sisters, how they have plunged into it. We have Office in Choir three times a day, meditation three times a day-consideration once-examination twice-and practices of mortification. It was beautiful to see our going round the choir [End Page 1] kissing the feet of all the sisters-then kneeling at the foot of the great cross accusing herself and begging the prayers of her sisters. Another kneeling to receive a public reprimand at the foot of the cross. Is it not delightful. I trust such may bring the blessing of God on us-enable us to do much good and to pay you for the American Hotel. I feel like getting into a nut-shell when I think of that awful debt. We all feel and express our gratitude for your goodness and generosity towards us, when you see so little prospect of our being able to make the return we would wish-especially we feel grateful for the manner in which you have the deeds drawn up-as our convent has already suffered so much from the want of attention to such points between friends. May our good God accept our poor service and may we all be instruments for His greater glory. I would like immediately after our retreat is over, to know your wishes about our going to the [End Page 2] new convent-and if you think it well we should open our school this next session &c &c. John thinks and so do our Sisters, that it will be necessary to purchase some of the furniture since we cannot have a large and empty house, and it will be cheaper and more suitable than any other. Last night, I recd from Revd P ONeil $50 for illegible Boys. I also sent you a $10 bill, which I always forget to mention. Did you ever get it? I have enjoyed the complimentary remarks from the Beaufort correspondent. I suppose all at home are delighted to have you administer confirmation in Cheraw it is the first time, is it not? Did I tell you that Mrs Semmes wrote to me from Georgia? I would not be surprised any day, to see her daughters. Col J Ryan very politely wrote to me, offering to make [End Page 3] my purchases while north, that we might wish. Have you seen the notices in the Columbia papers of your purchase? I wrote to Mother Teresa before the blessing of our Retreat to procure from her some of \"Illegible Retreat books\" for the postulants who cannot read French, but have not heard from her since. At the same time, I made my letter altho' cordial, a business one too and her I had made it my first care to look over her account and had made such reductions on each article as is customary for second hand furniture &c &c and that I would send her $300 very soon, I am sorry I forgot it the day you were here. I have not heard from her since. Did I tell you I had heard from Lizzie Cowdy? Give our love to home and our other friends if you please. I beg your fervent prayers for all but especially for your own sister, Ellen. Sr Baptiste Sup [End Page 4]"
