      "value": "27\nApril 1 ,1945\nHey old timer where are you. People write and say \nthey have read this and that in the paper and want to know what\nhappened, where you are headed for and is it true that you are\ngoing straight back to the front. To all of this I have to advise\nthem tot read the papers if they want the news. My probably\nguess is that you will stay inEurope until peace is made as\nthe excitement over there should be terrific, and you will\nbe there with so many of your friends. But please let me know\nin order that I may send my letters to the correct address as\nI have not the slightest idea where to send them now.\nYou organization is so marvellous. It first sent\nme a dispatch saying a woman had escaped from -- and had\narrived in Switzerland. They had no proof who she was but it\nmight be you. Another dispatch arrived the following day saying\nit w s thought to be you and that the woman was on her way to\nparis but there was no proof of her identiy. Th t evening\nJo Hughes called me from New York and said that it was in all\nthe papers. The following morning another dispatch arrived\nsaying that you had escaped but that the strictest secrecy must\nbe m int ined. This after it was out in all the papers. Of\ncourse That same day Time magazine produced it and I suppose\nlots of other pulicatio ns. However I am keeping very quiet\nabout it and when someone asks if I knew You have escaped I \njust look off into space with the eyes of a great spy.\nToday, Easter Sunday has been lovely. This morning\nI went swimming before going to the office, and the clear\ncool water was so lovely with the sun light running across it\nin brilliant silver bands that I never wanted to come out. Finaly\nwe dragged ourselves into our clothes and shut the office door\nbehind us. The neon lights seemed so out of place after that\nwonderful out of doors. There is no place like this island.\nAfter two and a half years I am still impressed by the\nweather and the lovely scenery. The brillant flowers that blaze\nalong the roads and the heavy vines that drip down from the \nporches. That is all porches except ours. I cannot get a vine\nto grow longer than five feet. For the first five feet it is\na veritable Jack in the Bean stalk arrangement , but then it\nloses heart and peters out. Perhaps that famous green\nthumb of yours will be able to do something with it.\nRed cross girls can come out here now without my\ntrouble. I do not think there is any difficulty in becomming\none of this specie and should imagine that you could if you wish.\n[End Page 1]\nThen it should be a very simple job for youto arrange to be sent\nto this island. It is no use your comming out in your present\norganization because it is in great disfavour out here and you\nwould not be sent I think. However anyway that is the simpliest\nis the best. However you have to come out as a memeber of an\norganization or a girl with a job waiting for her. It is\nimpossible to present yourself toa ship and say that you want\nto come out. Even thought you have all the arrangements made you\nwill find that you will have to wait in San Francisco for at\nleast six weeks, that is other people have to wait perhaps you\ncan arrange to obtain a quick passage.\nI suggest your comming out here as I cannot possibly\nsee how I could come back. I cannotask for leave because I\nhave just had it. I cannot ask for ten days to go back and see\nyou on the grounds that you have just escaped from a prison\ncamp because every day boys are refused permission to go back\nhome and see their dying parents. Of course if the Secretary of\nthe Navy wanted my opinion on the Pacific Theatre I might go\nback but then I would not have time to see you what with dinning\nat the White House and consulting with King each day. Anyway,\nlet me know what your plans are, how you are as soon as possible.\nThis afternoon we had a picnic for the men in our section.\nMorris and I played softball with them and we certainly were a\ncouple of old men. I was'nt even allowed to play and was told\nthat I could umpire. Morris caught and I must admit was pretty\ngood. He whilred the ball around the diamond, pulled balls to\nmake them look like strikes, and was up to all the tricks of an\nold timer. Afterwards he batted and that was his Waterloo\nbecause it meant that he has to run around the bases when he\nhits the ball. You could hear him puffing and grunting a mile\naway. After the exercise , hamburgers were cooked over and open\nfire, you should have been here to show them now it was done, and\nthen we threw a football back and forth just enought to realize\nit has been twenty years since we had sone this.\nHenry Lowndes wrote that Freddie Allen had telephones\nhim that you had escaped and he wanted to know how it had been\ndone etc. He is so interested and admires you so much that I\nthink if you have the time you should write him a letter. He\nhas always asked about you and has wanted to know the latest\nknews. I suppose the smart thing to do would be to mimeograph\nan account of your experiences and then when someone says tell me\nabout it, just hand them the sheet.\nGoodbye dear, I can hardly wait to hear from you and of\ncourse see you again. With all my love.\n[End Page 2]"
