      "value": "[Thomas Farr to Nathanael Greene\nSeptember 9, 1782\n[RvW Oversize Folder 71; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\nAshley River 9th September 1782\nDear General.\nMrs. Farr came up from Town Yesterday, by whom I have the following\nintelligence, which I think it's proper that you should be acquainted therewith. -\nThat eight victualling Ships, and five vessels loaded with dry Goods had lately\narrived in the port of Charles town: -  That the Vessels and Troops who had been to the Southwd\nwere returned, the Vessels they had loaded with Rice, live Stock, some Indico [Indigo], Household Furniture\nand other plunder, and a large number of negroes. That another expedition was putting out\nfor the like service, and would sail soon, supposed for the southward, inquest of Rice [and]ca. as they\nhad got intelligence, that a good deal of Rice was still on Combahe[e] River [- I have often known\nSchooners got [struck through] go from Town to Combahe[e] in one day, when the Wind has blown fresh at No East.] – \nThat the Loyalists in Charles Town had solicited Genl. [General] Leslie for leave to go out into the Country and make reprisals of all property they could lay their Hands on to compensate themselves for which\nthey had lost. That the merchants fearing that the British Debts would be seized on assuable\nto the Governors threat, had remonstrated with Genl. [General] Leslie against sending expeditions to the\nCountry and plundering property, particularly those by Water, but finding their Remonstrance\nnot attended to by Leslie, they had dispatched a Vessel last Friday to New York, with a represen-\n-tation thereof to Sir Guy Carleton.\nMrs. Farr was told by a Gentleman in town of Character, to mention to you, that he had\noccasion lately to go about the Lines on the back of the Town, where he had a good view of every Fort and\nFortification, that all the Cannon were taken away from the Horn Work and Lines, and every where\nelse, except one fort where there were three Cannon that there was only a Picquet Guard kept\nabout those Lines, and whilst the Troops were on the Expedition to the Southward, he apprehended that\nnothing could have prevented your Army getting into Town, as most of the Hessians were sick\nThat the partisan Colo. [Colonel] Fanning had been long soliciting Genl. [General] Leslie for a Command to \n[End Page 1]\ncome out into the Country, offering for a handsome Reward to carry the Head to Genl. [General] Leslie of\nof [sic] yourself, Genl. [General] Marion or any other person he might require, and that he, Fanning had actually\ngone out of Town last Thursday or Friday with only a Negro to endeavour to accomplish some vile\nPurpose – [Would it not be proper that Genl. [General] Marion should have a Hint of this?[]] – \nI am with great Respect,      Dear Sir.\nYour most obedient Servant.\nThos. Farr. [Thomas Farr]\n[Endorsed on left margin:]  From Thomas Farr\nSept. [September] 9th 1782\nX\n[End Page 2]"
