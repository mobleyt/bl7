      "value": "Edgefield Sept 10th 1841. Revnd and Dear Sir, I have long since been thinking of asking you to come up, and spend a Sunday with us, and can now defer it no longer-- Genl Wimbish, a young man very much esteemed among us, has lately we trust become a Christian, and is desirous to join our Church. He has asked me to write to Mr Wigfall, with whom he was intimate and request him to come over and baptize him-- He also begs that if you can possibly do so that you will come at the same time, and administer the sacrament of the Lords Supper-- He thinks, as most of us do, that if you both can meet here and preach two or three days, you may present our Church in its true light--, \"A church built upon the foundation of Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone\"-- Indeed My Dear Friend, a self humbling, and Christ exalting sermon, will be [written on side of page:] Do say nothing of my hints about Mr Shindlers preaching. [End Page 1] [sure?] thing in our Church-- Mr Shindler's preaching has so little of the unction of the spirit, and the grand theme of the Gospel, Redeeming love, is so seldom alluded to, that those of us who hunger and thirst after righteousness have only to feast upon our solemn Liturgy. For after that is read, we hear little about Christ-- The Baptists have had a meeting of a weeks duration. No converts were made, but I trust that many of their members were quickened in the divine life. Mr Shindler has injured the Church here, by refusing to attend the Baptist Meeting. I am happy to say however that all our members attended very regularly, and I trust were profited-- Genl Wimbish was ill in the early part of the summer and his sickness we hope has brought him to Christ. I want him to become acquainted with some of our Ministers who preach the Truth as it is in Jesus. And as he has requested you to come up,-- I feel afraid that if possible, you will do so. I know I am asking a great deal, but My Dear Sir, when you think how much [End Page 2] comfort, the faithful preaching of the word gives, you cannot refuse-- Wimbish will leave here in a day or two to attend some reviews in Abbeville But he will return by the 25th of this month. At that time the Methodists are to have a two day meeting, and we should not like to interfere-- He says that any time from the first of October will be best. I myself think that the second Sunday in October or perhaps the first will be best. However we leave it entirely to you-- Do answer this as soon as you receive it; I can then write to Wigfall, and let him know the Sunday. A stage leaves Aiken every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday morning and arrives here at Breakfast time. If you cannot get here on a Thursday, you might on Saturday. [You?] see, I have taken it for granted that you are to come-- I know you will not refuse. I need not say to you that we shall most certainly expect you to stay with us. Come directly to My house, and may the blessing of God come with you. If you should not be able to come, cant you [End Page 3] send young Mr Hanckel or Mr Campbel, or any one who will preach the doctrines of the Cross faithfully and zealously. But I must again insist upon your coming. I cannot give it up-- Do bring some of your most awakening sermons--. [written on side of page:] E.B. Bacon Sept 10th 1841. Ansd Sept 22nd 1841 The Revnd William Barnwell Charleston. S.C. Let me know immediately when you can come, as a letter is some time getting to Wigfall-- Present my kind regards to Mrs B and believe me yours truly Edmund B Bacon-- [End Page 4]"
