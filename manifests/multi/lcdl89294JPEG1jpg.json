The design includes flowers, leaves and birds on a main tree with butterflies and floral sprigs encircling the tree. At the base of the tree is mound of flowers with various birds including peacocks. The floral border is wide and printed with green leaves, brown flowers and tiny, yellow flowers. The whole quilt is multicolored on a white background. The backing is plain muslin in four vertical strips with woven binding tape all around. The center of the quilt has double line diagonals forming diamonds with a floral motif in the center. It isqQuilted around the tree motifs. And the border is quilted in crossed diagonal lines.  On the reverse, in dark blue cross-stitch, at top center is stitched: \"Burges / Dec 1833.\" The quilt was possibly made in Charleston by Margaret Eliza Darley Seyle Burges, the great, great-grandmother of the donor.  Margaret and James Smith Burges were the parents of Edward Burges.  Edward married Eveline Olivia Petsch.  Their son was Julius Eugene Burges, Sr., who married Anna Willissa Detwiler.  Their son was Julius Eugene Burges, Jr., the donor's father.  The quilt was given in 2010, by Gene Burges.",
