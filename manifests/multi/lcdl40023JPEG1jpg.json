      "value": "Charleston April 21st 1842-- My dear sons. You have heard from your Aunt, that it has pleased God to give you another little brother, Stephen and that both he & your Mama are well but you have also been sorry to hear that that same good God has sent a severe and dangerous sickness upon your other little brother Willie, and that perhaps you will never see him again till we all meet in Heaven, where I hope we shall all go when we die-- You loved little Willie very much & he loved you-- & Teddie in particular was very [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] playing with him-- but now poor [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] he cant play. & though he [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn. know?] me & his Mama at [times?] [illegible: page torn] take out [my?] Watch to [illegible: page torn] he [turns?] [illegible] [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] & [back?] to [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] & [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] to [illegible: page torn. suffer?] much, though [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] are very sore-- He lies [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn. lamb?], and I [would?] be glad if you [illegible: page torn] see him, but God knows what is best. The Doctor is very attentive. [End Page 1] comes round 4 times a day, and is doing all that he can, but you know my dear sons, it is only God who can save our lives, and your Mama & myself have given up our little boy into His hands. Jesus you remember raised up Jairus' daughter even after she was dead; & we know He can raise up your ill little brother, but His Will must be done & not ours-- Should He take our little boy to Himself then you know we shall have one of our own family gone to Heaven and we must all of us, think [more?] of Heaven, & talk more of it, & pray & strive more, that [when?] we die we may all go there-- I have sent by [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn. Grandmother?], to your Aunt Fuller. [We?] [illegible: page torn] for you, & [illegible: page torn. this?] you had [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] [Son?] in the next [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn. Perhaps?] [illegible: page torn] little [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] or [illegible: page torn. perhaps?] [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] [better?], but at [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] to come at [illegible: page torn. once?], & hope you [illegible: page torn] cheerfully--, Your little sisters [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] well during their sickness, & still do [illegible: page torn] that they are getting well, They feel a [great?] deal for little [End Page 2] Willie, & would miss him very much as they did you when you first went away, but I suppose they would soon forget him as is common with children-- May God bless you my sons. your father & mother feel quite anxious about your souls, & when we think of losing little Willie we think how much worse if it should be one of you who must answer for your sins, and who ought to believe in & love Jesus-- Your Mama joins your Papa in this letter, which I have read to her. Your affectionate father. W.H. Barnwell Masters Robert & Edward Barnwell [End Page 3] Masters Robt. & Edwd. Barnwell Beaufort So Ca [End Page 4]"
