      "value": "Reprinted from The Woman Citizen, May, 1926  A  ady  of Many  Gardens  .  jeiu of Frances  Benjamin Johnston\"s  photographs of European gardens.  Above-The I\"iia  [\"ypris, at Cap Martin  on the French Riviera.  .It the eft-the poo  and cypresses at the  Via Vaconicri, Itay,  and at the right, a itte garden court of the  .hambra,  Spain.  By  Caroine  Avis  OF course it would have been  pleasanter to interview her  in a garden and watch her  at work with her camera.  Next best was the quiet exhibition room whose was were ined  with her ovey photographs of old  Word garden beauty, while a fountain  pashed appropriatey in the center.  And third best was the high hote room  where   the  ady  of   the  gardens   ived  among bewidering folders of prints and  her precious garden books of a the ages,  with bits of transported beauty here and  there-pierced brass, red acquer, a poo  of rosy beads-proving the ove of coor  on which Frances Benjamin Johnston  ives.  Miss Johnston owns no gardens.  They are hers by right of knowedge,  ove and artistic presentation. Over  most of the word she has photographed  them-and the ist shows names dear in  many a traveer\"s memory: gardens of  the Via Borghese, those about Frascati,  Viterbo, Tivoi, the gardens of the  French chateaux, of Syria, of the Aham-  bra, and of the country which is a a  garden-Engand. To picturing them  she has brought a finey developed photographic technique, an unusua feeling for  composition, a knowledge of gardens  based on first-hand study and wide read- \n\n[End Page 1]\nThe massed cimbing roses of the upper picture are at  the Via a Pietra,  near Forence.  Ieoiu, the viater  garden ana Chinese  pagoda on ord  and ady Astor\"s  estate, Civeden, at  Tapoii-on- Thames  ing, and a sincere wish to  use her art as a background for disseminating a  sense of beauty.  A pioneer by heritage  and nature, she was perhaps the first woman in  this country who went deiberatey into photography as a profession ; the  only woman at the InterNational Congress of Photography held in Paris in  1900. Before photography there was study at  Juien\"s in Paris and at  the Art Students\" League  in Washington. In those  days Miss Johnston had  ambitions to be an iustrator with brush  and penci, but chance defected her, and  amost before she knew it she became one  with the ens and was pioneering in the  business of picturing Presidents, cabinet  ministers and other Washington notables.  A family background of social prominence gave her easy access to the great,  who had not yet become hardened to facing a camera at every turn, and for some  years Frances Johnston made portraits,  free from the bight of stiffness and retouching, in her Washington studio.  Somewhere along the way she took time  for a thorough technical training in the  Smithsonian aboratories, which incidentay introduced her to coor photography  in its infancy. She eagery watched each  eary coor process, and hersef did some  of the first autochromes.  It was her ove of coor that ed her  to picture gardens. She had aways  oved them, growing up in her grandmother\"s od-fashioned garden at Roches  ter, a city noted for its fowers; and ater  estabishing her first studio in the famous  rose garden of her own home in Washington. She knew fowers by their first  names. Graduay she began to show  sides and tak garden tak. From autochromes she turned to back and whites,  so skifuy taken that coor could be  successfuy appied and so that in some  uncanny way they actuay suggest coor  values themseves. Meantime she was  coecting and studying garden books [a  deectable collection it is, with sober  garden history nudging \"Fora\"s Interpreter\" on her sheves], and by the time  she was ready for the centuries-od gardens of Europe she was steeped in their  ore. last year for seven months,  equipped with etters from ambassadors  and other great ones to open guarded  gates, she photographed abroad. This  year she is teing the story. Another  year she will find other gardens to picture.  Aways in her ectures  she has to expain that  these old Word gardens  of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries do not  necessariy mean fowers.  The Itaian gardens, for  instance, on which most  forma garden design is  based, had few fowers except as incidenta to the  season. It was the Itaians who, when the old  days of living behind fortress was had passed, began to develop the garden  as a ink between the  dweing and the andscape. The architectural  ines of the house were carried out on to  the and in stone, verdure, water; but  actua fowers were usually only a ovey  incident. French andscape architects  took up the Itaian idea, adapting it to a  country less mountainous.  Garden evoutions and even revoutions are famiiar notions to Miss  Johnston. She will te you what  happened to the Itaian infuence in  England through the essays of Pope, and  how the Chinese \"naturaistic\" stye for  a time touched every country. andscape architects of the ages-Vignoa,  enotre-and tidbits of gossip about  what various ouis did to this or that  architect to express peasure or otherwise  -these are every-day names and stories  to Miss Johnston.  She has given her ore to the Public in  ectures, artices, photographs. And her  interest is not only in her profession but  in a bit of propaganda for garden beauty  at home. \n\n[End Page 2]"
