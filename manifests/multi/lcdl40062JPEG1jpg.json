      "value": "Phil. Dec. 5. 1846 My dear Brother, I was truly glad to receive your letter, in addition to that of Mr. Clarkson & tho' you have not said all, which you had to say, in favor of my coming to C-- I feel much confirmed in my impression that the Lord has called me, to go again to your city, & make fuller proof of my ministry there than I was able to do aforetime. The information you give me, respecting the opposition of some, & the fears of others, was scarcely necessary as I knew very well that this difficulty must exist. Still I was glad to find that the leading friends of the enterprise had counted the cost, & hope that you & they are correct in the impression that it is not an insuperable obstacle. I rely upon you & your counsellors, as better able to judge of this than myself & if it is not to defeat the undertaking, it shall not prevent me from cooperating, however trying to my feeling. I took the precaution [End Page 1] to consult Ladson on this point, & his ideas are much the same as your own. He too is indeed a partial friend, but not I think a very sanguine one, & tho' friendly to the enterprise, is not so much interested as to blind his judgment while his knowledge of the feelings of others is I presuppose pretty general. I am sorry to find, that their only sure dependance [sic] for the salary, is upon shoulders, which however broad, are already heavily laden. But I hope your arrangements are made for the best, & I shall trust to Providence to take care of both you & me. You see then, that my mind is made up, & that in accordance with your wishes, I am desirous to keep you all no longer in suspense. I have therefore prepared my answer to the Vestry, but do not send it now because I wish to consult you on two points, before it is communicated. The 1st is, respecting the increase of the subscription list. I cannot help desiring that it were more nearly equal to the estimated cost & it has been a question in my mind & that of my advisers, clerical & lay, whether[End Page 2] a conditional acceptance, would not be more likely to promote this, than a positive one. I am aware however that this might generate as an hindrance rather than an inducement but I am inclined to think the former, & I am willing to leave this point to yourself & the vestry to determine. The 2nd point is respecting the vacancy at St. M's. It has struck me as singular, that it should occur at this moment, and I could not [tell?] whether the great Head of the Church did not intend me to return thither, or whether you yourself might not think the same great end even more likely to be gained by this means. Not that I at all desire such an arrangement on my own account, tho' of course it is natural for me to be attached to the spot & to many of the people, who have claims upon me, if they are able & willing to urge them. I have learned that the matter is in agitation & perhaps ere this it may be decided in such a way as to give me no perplexity. If however the contrary is at all probable, I should [End Page 3] like to have your views, & should feel under peculiar obligation to consider your wishes & the vestry of Grace Church, in consequence of all that has already passed. I should certainly prefer more unanimity than could be expected there even in a narrower sphere. But at the same time, I am willing I trust to go any where & bear any thing that the Lord seems to appoint. As soon as I hear from you, I shall decide, & can come to you as soon after the 1st Jan, as you wish. Trusting sincerely that the lord may direct us both in all things, I am. Your affec fr & br W.W. Spear Rev W.W. Spear Dec. 1846 1846 Philadelphia PA Rev W.H. Barnwell Charleston So Carolina[End Page 4]"
