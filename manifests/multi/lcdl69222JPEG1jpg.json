      "value": "No 1\nDear Gertie,\nI received your letter of May 26th. and the enclosed copy of the\nletter from George Buist this morning. As you do not speak of anyof letters\nI am worried that they are not arriving. I am sorry as I am writing to you\nevery day and do not know what is happening to the mail. In order that\nwe may see just how bad it is I have numbered this letter 1 and from now\non will faithfully follow this method and you can let me know what is happening\nas to the letters you receive.\nYour discription of the ball game was heavenly. I thought the crooners,\nand all the side shows were marvellous. It resembles a corner drug store.\nEverything but drugs in the case of one[,] and everything but baseball in the case\nof the other. That is how America seems to be. Without the sdie trim ings you\nhave nothing. Everything must be a double header or the crowds will not come.\nSuper salesmanship or nothing. When we have that little farm in Virginia\nwe will put you in charge of the sell ng and you will somehow convince people\nthat our carrots are the best in the world. I suppose our road side stand will\nhave a band and a few crooners going full tiltwhile hot water bottles and toasters\nare sold on the side.\nI am inclined to agree with George Buist that it is wiser to\naccept an offer from the government in the amount of approximately $2O.00\nand acre than take it to court because the law fees will eat up any bit\nin excen that you might obtain. Further I do not think that the goverment will\ntake into consideration that we have lost a thing most valuable to us, the abilility\nto ride over the countryside without interference feeling as free as the wind.\nNeither will they consider that an amunition dump is not the happiest thing to\nhave next to our house. For these reasons I advise taking ard offer of twenty\ndollars and at the same time going on written record with the government that\nwe paid fifty dollars an acre[,]as we paid one hundre[d]and ten thousand for the 2200\nacres.\nAn entirely different situation arises when the claim for the land\ntaken for the canal is brought up in court. Here it will not be a question\nof acrage but of distraction of bea[u]ty and the m[A]king of the place untenable as\na home. Besides the harm done the building by blasting etc. This will have to\ngo intothe courts unless they are willing to pay us plenty. If you approve of\nthe enclosed letter to George send it along after you have signed it. If you\ndo not approve rewrite it and than send it along telling him that I concurr\nin your opinion.\nShould you obtain approxmately six thougend dollars for the land\ntaken I would put int in a special account for thepurchase of another home somewehr[e]\nafter the war. We should be able to buy such a place purely with money obtained\nfrom Medway land and timber and still hold the great part of Medway and the timber.\nDo not put t[h]is money in your checking account or it will go like the wind.\n[End Page 1]\nI do not think we have to pay any income tax on any money received\nfor the sale of this land from the government because we paid fifty dollars an\nacre and they are only giving us twenty so if anything it looks to me as if\nwe should be able to take a loss.\nNothing makes me laugh harder than when I read in your letters that you\nsup ose I wil want to lead a bac[h]elor life after the war and you wonder how\nI will react to our being together again. If there wasnt a censor I would tell\nyou exactly how I would react. In my mind there is not the slightest doubt\na[s] to our life together after his war. The only thing that is discourging\nis that the end of the war seems so far off. However it will end some day\nor they will retire me for old age. I t ink after sixty they will not let you\nstay in the navy so then I will come home and we will do the t[h]ings we want to.\nMen are really going back all the time, one that I knew just left, thought he\nwas going to be out here for a long time and he is off now. It is purely\na question of what the Bureau is feeling like as to where you go and what you\ndo. Probably if iPut in an application to remain in the Hawaiian islands the\nreminder of my life I would be transferred to Iceland tomorrow. That is how\nthings work. You must not become discouraged with your job or our being\nseperated. It will come to an end soon and then this year will seem very insig\nnificant compared to the long years that will lie ahead of us.\nThe pestoring of the two air conditi[o]ning units to health and vigor was\nmarvellous. How wonderful and how like Washington to have two men work all\nday in the home thinking they were doing work for someone else and then findin[g]\nthat they were in the wrong place after everthing had been finished. I am so\nglad that you will have these units because they are the only way you can\nohtain any sleep.\nThe house in Watch Hill sounds marvellous and I am so glad you were\nable to obtain one. You have become so efficent that I do not intend to do\none thing when I return. All check books , business papers and letters etc.\nwill be given to you while I lie in a hammock and sleep, read, pat honeys head\nand grunt with pleasure ast se[e]ing everyone else work. Perhaps we had better\nbuy Rose a hoe now so she gets the habit of worldng in the fields hoeing de\ncotton.\nI have been swimming every day, but camot tell you anything about it\nbecaxuse after describing swimming and surf boarding several times there is\nnoting else to say about it. You repeat the same strokes, fall off the same way,\nand think and see the same things. The water if anything is slightlxy bluer,\nthe waves much ,larger, [too large] and all the real old timers are now out\nthat[T]he surfing season has commenced. I never catch a wave anymore. They all\ndu[M]p me on my head, I also have not yet learned to do the crawl, this being\nmy twentieth year at trying to do it. I eat more than anyone else in Hawaii,\nsleep wonderfuly , love the soft nights, palm trees and air heavy with perfume\nand the tiny breezes that play amongst the palm fronds. I drink scotch, bourbon\nrye, gin, champagne, and beer, ride about in my car, back and forth to work,\nand would t[H]ink t is heaven on earth if only you were here. I miss you\nterribly and send you all my love darling. You know everything bal[a]nces up\nand now that to[D]ay is the anniversary of my arrival in Washington and Navy duti[e]s\nperhaps the comming year will bring us together rather than apart. I certainly\nhope and pray so.\nP.S Will send you the letter\nto George Buist tomorrow Sidney J Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
