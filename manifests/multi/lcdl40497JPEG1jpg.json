      "value": "December 3, 1962 Mrs. J. Howard Webb Route 2 Box 195 Citra, Florida Dear Lucille: Gussie has turned over to me your letter of November 18, 1962 in order that I may pass on to you such information as I have respecting the Allen family and the Fowke line. I am sorry that I have at the present time no information about the Johnson family. FIRST I GIVE YOU THE ALLEN [LINE?] The first of this family to come to South Carolina was Sherward Allen, who came to South Carolina in 1772 from Richmond, Virginia and seems to have lived partly in Edgefield District, S. C. and Augusta, Georgia. He married Mary Cargill (born about 1750), who was the daughter of John Cargill, living on the Saluda River and his wife, Receccah. The will of John Cargill is probated in Char;eston in the 1780’s. This will mentions his daughter Mary Allen, and his wife, Rebeccuh. Sherwood allen died in Augusta, Georgia and is buried in the Episcopal Church yard. Mary his wife died in 1823. They had the following children: ORSAMUS D, ALLEN, BORN 1774 DIED [illegible] 1847. He married Harriet D. Duncan and they had one son, Joseph D. Allen, but this line is now extinct. SARAH ALLEN, who in 1794 married in Augusta, Georgia, Judge Richard Gantt of South Carolina and died November 17, 1838, and has a large number of descendants. JOHN CARGILL ALLEN, born in Edgefield District about 1778 and died in Barnwell, S. C. April 18, 1824 and is buried in the Baptist Church Yard . THIS IS OUR LINE. He is said to have been a distinguished lawyer and a wealth planter of Barnwell County. He married Sarah Williamson, daughter of Dr. Vincent Peter Williamson of Edgefield and Elizabeth White, his wife, said to be the daughter of Bishop White of Philadelphia. They had no sons but six daughters known as “The Six Beautiful Allens”, as follows. (a) CAROLINA ALLEN, who married Dr. Samuel Hamilton. Their only child married Dr. McNeil of Alabama and left descendants in that State. (b) AUGUSTA ALLEN, born in 1801, died in 1877. This is my line. She married William Henry Smith of Smithfield Plantation in Edgefield County, and they had a number of children including my grandmother Eliza Caroline Smith, who married my grandfather Dr. Thomas Woodward Hutson. (c) COLUMBIA ALLEN, who married Edmund Bellinger, a prominent lawyer and a lineal descendant of Landgrave Edmund Bellinger. From this marriage there are a number of descendants in South Carolina. (d) INDIANA ALLEN, born September 3, 1910, died March 6, 1877. She married Dr. James O, Hagood. From this marriage came the Confederate General and Governor of South Carolina, General Johnson Hagood and a number of descendants. (e) HARRIETTA ALLEN (Your Line) , who married Dr. R.C. Fowke and left descendants in South Carolina and Georgia. They had a daughter Jessie, who married ___ Chisholm, and I believe other lines such as Dickenson, Hewlett, Traynor, Johnson and Woodruff. (f) Juliana Allen, who married Morrison and left descendants in Texas. Had one son and daughter who married Gantt , Call and McMarrough.[End Page 1] NOW AS TO THE FOWKE LINE The first of the Fowke family in America would appear to be Gerard Fowke Sr., born in England, Came to Virginia 1654, Died 1669 in Virginia. He was a Member of the House of Burgesses , Charles County, 1665. Moved to Maryland 1667. Member of Maryland Assembly 1668. It would appear that the first of the Fowke family to reach South Carolina was Dr. John Sydenham Fowke, who married Sarah Becket Johnson. And it was their son Dr. R. C. Fowke who married Harrietta Allen, as set forth in the account of the Allen family herein. I hope that the above will be of some assistance to you in tracing the lines you are interested in. With kindest regards, I am, Sincerely yours, James B. Heyward[End Page 2]"
