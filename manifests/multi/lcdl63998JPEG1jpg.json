      "value": "Princeton 18th July 1806    My Dear Mother  The shirts which you were so kind as to send me the last winter are all very good and strong; but those are the only ones which I have, for the others are all worn out, so that if I wish to put on more than usual I am sure to be out, and that happened particularly the last vacation when I was obliged to be very economical. I shall be obliged to you to put frills to the next parcel which you send; and if you will also put some cotton or silk stockings in the same box they will be very acceptable, as they are very difficult to be got in Princeton that is to say good ones.    My Aunt Middleton is now I understand in N.Y. She went from Baltimore there by some road in the back part of this state, at least I conclude it must be in the back part, as I am told it is by much the shortest way, however be that as it will it occasioned our not seeing her so that [End Page 1] I shall now think myself very fortunate if I see her atall. Her going by this road Elizabeth says was occasioned by the driver, so that My Aunt could not have known it until she was some distance on her journey, which I am very much surprised at as she has travelled the road before.    Elizabeth Middleton mentioned to me also a very providential escape of the whole family almost However I will give it to you in her own words without any contractions or additions - \"On Thursday last as My Aunt, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Harriet and myself were coming up Broadway in the carriage we saw a boy coming full speed up one of the cross streets towards the carriage, the boy had not time to guide the horse a different way he was going with such rapidity, you may guess with what force he came for in a moment the carriage was overset and draged a considerable way on its side with all of us in it. We all behaved remarkably well and did not scream atall: fortunately Mr L. Maris and A. Smith were before in a chair and came to our assistance in a moment we were surrounded by a great crowd, the carriage lifted up and all of us taken out some more dead than alive. We  [End Page 2] were all a little bruised but E and My Aunt much the most so\"  but you must not conclude from this My Dear Mama that there were any of them much hurt for I find a postscript to my letter written by E. Man so that they all had as I have already said a providential escape.    I intend if I have enough cash to spare and there is no fever at the time to go to Philadelphia in the vacation    I am  Yr. Dutiful Son  Nathaniel Heyward [End Page 3] [Stamp] Princeton. N J. Aug 19    [In large script] 25    Mrs. Nathl. Heyward  Charleston  So. Carolina [End Page 4]"
