      "value": "Coosaw, May 12th 1828 You shall not think Dearest Anna that in Emma Barnwell-Emma Elliott has forgotten her old-tried & dearest friends--but since marriage, my time has been so fully occupied & cut up by moving from one place to another that I have been prevented (against inclination) keeping up a regular correspondence even with my own immediate family--we have moved up & down to this place three times--paid a visit to one of Mr. Barnwell's sisters--& one to Savannah purposely to see my dear brother William--in which pleasure I was most dreadfully disappointed--owing to a letter written by himself from [illegible] to Phoebe in Columbia, saying that he expected leaving Savannah the latter part of April--her stay both in Charleston & with me was very much shortened--& we hurried on to Savannah much sooner than we either wished or intended--the consequence was that owing to some unforseen delay up the country--Wm was detained & although we remained ten days in S-- we lost the opportunity of seeing him, he had not even arrived a week after we left--Mary I found looking very pale & delicate--but quite happy in her little son Robert who is a sweet little boy quite pretty & what is of more importance[End Page 1] quite well--They all seem quite happy in the prospect of an up country settlement--I hope my dear girls that when Phoebe comes down to pay me a visit--you will meet her here--unless (as report says) you have become so extremely attached to Georgetown that you could not spare even a moment to your friends--indeed dear Anna--as a friend & one deeply interested in your welfare--you might entrust the secret to me--which by the bye seems no secret at all--as a friend to you all I congratulate you on your brother's engagement--for although I am not personally acquainted with the young lady--& therefore know not if it be a cause of congratulation--yet you must all feel happy in witnessing the happiness of your brother (which I take it for granted is very great) as is general on such occasions--& that she may prove a valuable addition to your delightful & happy family is my sincere wish-- Oh my dear Anna what has not poor Charleston suffered by fire--I could have wept over her ruins--& the ruin of so many of her children--but it is cheering to see a ray of hope still beaming amid the general gloom & that ray indicating such promising signs of redoubled seal--& industry for the improvement of the fallen city--surely[End Page 2] her citizens have every reason to expect assistance from on high in their efforts--for their first act was [boring?] in humble submission to the Author of their calamity & then beseeching his powerful arm to assist them in their arduous work the rebuilding of Charleston--The Poor Methodists have shared heavily in the destruction of their papers \"the Christian Advocate\" is filled with their lamentations for the loss of two of their churches--in it they appeal indiscriminately for assistance from every quarter & \"beg for Christ's sake to give money for building a church for the poor & the poorest\"--They are so poor that of course the loss falls more heavily on them than others--& as an [illegible] to be sent throughout the states for the purpose of collecting funds--I hope that they soon may build in the general rebuilding-- Dear Anna do write & give me an account of yourself--family & my Charleston friends for it is so long since I have heard from any one from there that I feel almost cut off from all communication with my dear old friend. Where do you intend spending your summer & when do you remove to Georgetown? With much love to Sarah -- & all of your family--I will sign myself Dearest Anna your sincere friend Emma Barnwell[End Page 3] To/Miss Anna B. Wilkinson Care of Dr. W. Wilkinson Charleston So.
