      "value": "18 November, 1941  Mr. William N. Beach,  Rice Hope plantation,  Georgetown, South Carolina.  Dear Mr. Beach, Yesterday at a meeting of the Charleston regional planning Committee of the Carolina Art Associaltion, one of the members spoke of the development of the property between least Bay and Church Street, which you own at present. Since this proerty [property] is located in the midst of historic area and is surrounded by some of Charlestons most characteristic buildings, we fee that it is important to give it carefu treatment, to estabish standards for the buildings to be erected upon it, to maintain such characteristic features as the wa along ongitude ane, and to otherwise insure the development of the site as a worthy and suitable addition to the architura assets of Charleston.  Therefore, it is not in a spirit of interfence [interference], buit in one of co-operation that we write to you. We fee that you would be interested in knowing of the existence and the aims of our committee. This committee was organized a year and a haf ago by a group that was deepy concerned about the forces which are graduay but inevitaby wearing away the amenities which make Charleston pleasant to those who ive in it and interesting to those who visit it. The committee had the advice of Mr. Frederick aw Olmstead, and at his suggestion began a survey of the architectural wath [weath] and a study for a plan to preserve that wealth and to infuence new developments in such a way that it will be increased and not diminished. The results of this survey and study will shorty be put before the Public in the form of an exhibition.   We hope that you will come to see the exhibition and will give the committee the benefit of your interest and co-operation. Meanwhie, if there is anything that we can do for you in the development of the site in question, such as putting at your service our fies and photograph coection, we shall be very happy to do so.  Sincerely yours,  Homer N. place, Chairman"
