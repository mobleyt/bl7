      "value": "Tapestry Weavers.  Let us take our hearts a lesson--no lesson can nobler be--  From the ways of the tapestry weavers, on the other side of the sea.  Above their heads their pattern hangs; they study it with care;  And while their fingers deftly work, their eyes are fastened there.  They tell this curious thing, beside, of the patient, plodding weaver:  He works on the wrong side evermore, but he works for the right side  ever.  It is only when the weaving stops, and the web is loosed and turned,  That he sees his real handiwork, that his marvelous skill is learned.  Oh!  the sight of it delicate beauty!  How it pays him for all it cost!  No rarer, daintier work than his was ever done by the frost.  Then his master bringeth him golden hire, and giveth him praise as well,  And how happy the heart of the weaver is, no tongue but his own  can tell.  The years of man are the looms of God let down from the place of the  sun;  Whereon we are weaving always till the appointed task is done.  Weaving blindly, but weaving surely, each man for himself his fate.  We may not see how the right side looks, we can only weave and wait.  But looking above for the pattern, no weaver need have fear;  Only let him look clear into heaven--the perfect patter in there.  If he keep the face of the Master forever and always in sight,  His weaving is sure to be perfect, his work is sure to be right.  And at last, when the task is ended, and the web is turned and shown,  He shall hear the voice of his Master; it shall say unto him: “Well  done!”  And the white-winged angels of heaven to bear him thence shall come  down;  And God for his wage shall give him, not coin, but a golden crown!  This beautiful poem has often appeared anonymously.  C. T. Wettstein, of Milwaukee, Wis., searched for the author recently, and received word from Mr. G. Marvin, of Savannah, Mo., and the Mrs. Frances Carter, of Stelia, Mo., saying that Anson G. Chester, M. D., penned the lines.  Mrs. Carter adds: “The poem has as wonderful a history as the man who wrote it.  It has been published in all the modern languages, including Hindustania, Chinese, and Japanese.  It appeared first in The Century Magazine.  Dr. Williamson, of London, has issued hundreds of thousands of copies of it in leaflet form, having gone to the press with it four times in 1912.  The University of Tokyo gave it out for interpretation to 400 students, who were asked to send to Dr. Chester with their interpretations.”  “In my opinion,” adds Mr. Wettstein, “this poem is one of the most beautiful, almost sublime, inspired poems that ever was written.  I think it is worth preserving for future reference.”--Zions Herald.  [written on side of page:] read this but be sure to return it some day-- I think it beautiful--"
