      "value": "Charleston May 24*th 1848 My Dear Mamma, Sitting in your chamber, before the best window in the enjoyment of a fine breeze, I come to wish you good morning on this my 39th birthday & 10th wedding annual. I was very sick all last week confined to the bed from Monday night to Sunday--all the while under the influence of Laudanum, Morphine, or something of the sort, to ward off a severe [threat?]. I have now been free from pain about 38 hours, a longer interval of ease than I have had for more than a week--I have seen [Mary?] but once, she was here for a few moments Saturday afternoon--I have not even heard from her, but I suppose she is busy getting ready to go away & all the time she has had to spare, she has been giving to visit the little Lucas' who have lost their Father. I don't know when I have been made to feel so much for any one as I did yesterday for Mr. Belin--learning of the death of his little boy--'tis indeed a severe blow to him--how inscrutable are the ways of Providence! Mary sent me a letter last night from Virginia, very touching & afflicting, but at the [different handwriting] *Anna has mistaken the date, this being the 23rd [End Page 1] same time gratifying, for the event seems to have made more deep religious impressions upon her than she has experienced for years--the Lord grant the visitation may be sanctified to her--they are to be down to-morrow. Sarah says William will not be on before August, so I suppose you will come down & stay here until Papa returns from Sumpter [Sumter]? This I think will be your best arrangement--at least I hope you will thus arrange your movements--Mow Jinny is now gone to bed, a regular knock under I'm afraid, from sleeping in for a few nights--although, she had a comfortable bed & no night disturbance. I assure you if it were not for [Clarim?] I know not what I should do--she puts all the chambers to right--assists with washing from breakfast to dinner & then comes in for the afternoon. Peggy was here last night--if Mow continues sick she will send Georgia to me for a few days--or as long as I may require her. Little Anna, continues [illegible] delicate, she is picking up, but the complaint hangs on her & is so bad as to give a great deal of trouble & make a great deal of washing [End Page 2] Eleanora continues delicate, but is improving--Eliza was here yesterday morning, took the trouble to walk a hot morning, & brought me in her own hands a little jar of blackberry jelly--some she had just made, which she said she thought I might fancy--the attention I assure you was grateful to me--I was so glad to be able to send her in the carriage to do some little shopping, before it took her home--James came up in my chamber & spent last evening with me--he was in a very pleasant humour--he made his first speech in Court in Charleston, a few days ago. Mr. K & both Johns [?] sent expressly to hear him--they say he acquitted himself well--his language was fluent & fine, his manner effective, & his elocution finished--his enunciation polished--they think he gives promise of being a fine speaker. On the law, they say, he was admirable. Well I am now quite longing to hear of my dear little daughter again--I hope she continues good & will be quite a little comfort to her dear Grandmamma & Grandpapa--tell her we all remember her in our prayers. Give her a kiss for us & much love & accept the same, my dear Mamma from yr affec daughter Anna [End Page 3] [different handwriting] Tell Rie that her Papa almost despairs of coming up, as, even if he could make it otherwise convenient, he does not like to leave her Mamma. She is pretty well again, but has been so seriously sick that her Papa would feel quite uneasy if he were absent, lest she should be taken in the same way. He hopes Rie is enjoying herself & continues as good a girl as when Grandpapa & Grandmamma wrote. She remembers his name for her, & that he calls her \"my blessing;\" & so he hopes she always will be. We often talk about her & wonder what she is doing. They all missed her very much, & especially her little admirer Ella; & Anna still sings her \"Yia, Yia.\" Mrs. E. Wilkinson Care of Dr. W. Wilkinson Orangeburg So. Ca. [End Page 4]"
