      "value": "C. BISSE JENKINS, Jr.    Meeting of  CIVIC SERVICES COMMITTEE  August 1,  1944    Report of Fire Insurance Rates - affected by present interior  bock conditions   Charleston,being one of the most congested cities in the  entire country, has aways been confronted with problems  originating from this cause, and one of the chief problems In  this respect has been the matter of fire insurance rates. In  spite of the congested conditions that prevai, however, the  city has nevertheess enjoyed a remarkaby good record as far  as fires are concerned.  Improvements have been made in the rating of various types  of properties In recent years, but due to the congestion which  creates exposure chlarges the rates have aways been relatively  high as compared to other cities of the same size, these rates,  however, are not so high as they should be from a technical  standpoint on account of the unusuay good fire record of the  city. In other words, on mercantie properties In the city  arbitrary rates have been arrived at, instead of making chlarges  for a exposures that exist. In certain areas of King Street,  for exampe, there is in effect What is known as a \"\"stop rate,\"  which means that the rate cannot go beyond a certain amount. If  such an arbitrary rate were not in effect and a exposure chlarges  made, rates would be In some Instances double or three times what  they are.  We now come to a very unusua situation, In that if the  property owner should decide to make Improvements In his property  that would under norma conditions Improve the fire Insurance  rate structure on the property, the Rating Bureau is required then  to chlarge for the various exposures that were formery omitted in  the rate, and thus the credit derived by improving the property  would be more than offset and would result in a net increase in the  rate. while the property owners in most mercantie areas are receliving comparativey ow rates in view of the various rues that  exist, there is no encouragement to make certain improvements and  thus reduce the fire hazard, for in most eases the rate would be  increased. In ike manner, if two or three buildings together are  torn down In a given bock to make room for a parking area, it is  very doubtfu whether the remaining buildings in the bock would  have their rates reduced and possiby In some cases there may be an  increase based on the facts as above shown,  A further investigation of this matter is being made for a more  compete study, but the above represents typica cases that have  been actuay experienced In the past several years,"
