      "value": "Marietta, 24th Jan. 1844 Rev. & Dear Bro., I have proposed for several weeks to write you, but have delayed until it now appears almost unnecessary. The first matter of remark is respecting the Episcopal Protestant--the reason of my not having become a subscriber is, that all the little means we can spare are needed in the infant enterprise with which our Church furnishes us-- for stoves, fuel, Prayer Books, S.S. Books, &c. Anxious at the same time to avail ourselves of the advantages of Periodical reading, we agreed to make common stock of our papers. According to this arrangement, Mr. Garnett subscribed for the Ep. Prot. and we have the reading of three papers. To those in better worldly circumstances, and unused to the straits of such an enterprise as ours, this may seem to be extreme economy, but limited as our means are, and yet desirous to be independent, we find it absolutely necessary. I trust it will some day be better with us. Of the paper itself, of course it is not my province to speak, farther than that generally I am pleased with its character--as much as I can say of any similar work. I must say that I dread the result [End Page 1] which I fear is to follow upon the present attitude of the periodical press. The scorching fire through which it was my lot to pass a few years since, have inspired me perhaps with too much sensitiveness. Truth I doubt not will ultimately prevail; but I fear the collection of its attenuate parts can only be effected after an utter explosion. And what enhances the dread is that each successive development, instead of allaying, seems only to increase the fermentation. The practical result of this state of things on our infant parishes is ruinous -- it bars every rational hope of additions to our numbers. The remark of the Bishop of Michigan (Spirit of Miss -- Jan 1844 p.16) I find literally true. Our efforts are completely paralysed by the mutual assaults and representations of Churchmen themselves. My own views are distinctly settled upon all the points at issue; and I do not hesitate to say that the largest measures of blame, in my opinion, rests upon the extreme High Church party. But still if the actual state of the Church be what it is represented by the opposite side, persons not already strongly inclined towards it will surely not enter its communion. This is a question of fact which will be settled by readers for themselves upon the testimony of the Press. The result is by no means problematical, as the press under control of other denominations eagerly circulates every expression which can be turned to our detriment.[End Page 2] I have been led into this course of remark, hoping it may, in a very humble degree, tend to promote an end which I am sure is dear to your heart. And I trust your Journal may be directed to the honored instrumentality of \"sowing peace.\" I have long forborne to say any thing through the papers. One can scarcely say any thing to which some other will not reply in such way as to produce controversy. Not that I would so avoid controversy as to permit truth to suffer--that were unbecoming a Christian man--but I vastly prefer, as long as I may be permitted, to oppose error by the noiseless propagation of truth. I beg therefore you will not construe my backwardness in circulating the Ep. Prot. into any want of interest in the advancement of truth, or of personal regard for its Editor, which is entertained in a high degree. The reason is bona fide, as stated at the outset. There are many topics upon which I should be pleased to dwell, were I permitted the pleasure of a personal interview, but which must now be passed over. Your position in the church has long been a responsible one. It is now doubly so. The Lord grant you grace to sustain it for his glory, and the welfare of his church--pray with Your servt. and brother-- Thomas F. Scott This is, of course, a private letter. [End Page 3] Tho. F. Scott Jan. 3 1844 <MARIETTA JAN 24 Ga> [In Margin] 18 3/4 Rev. Wm H. Barnwell Charleston, S. Carolina [End Page 4]"
