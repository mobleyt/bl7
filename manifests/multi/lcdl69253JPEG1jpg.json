      "value": "March 9, 1943\nGertie Darling, \nIt is winter here now. Last night the wind\nhowled around our apartment and the ventian blinds rattled and\nbanged loke machine guns. The rain drumxed against the black out\npanes with that heavy beat of big drops that you get only in\nsub tropical countries and the air was wet with moisture so\nthat I pulled the blanket around my neck instead of the damp .\nsheet. This morning there were no lights and we dressed in\nthe darkness groaning about the hardships of war and our fate.\nHowever after prunes, hot cakes, sausages, and fried eggs at the\nBOQ I felt better and with my little razor in my pocket continue\nonto the office. There Iplugged my razor into the circuit,\nput my feet on the desk and shaved as I talked to the Yeoman\nand heard the latest news. fNow I mm once more presentable,\nThe captain has passed into his office so I have put all the\ndummy papers away and seizing my typewriter am wr[i]ting to you.\nLast night we [w]ent to the movies and saw Monte\nWooly in the\"Pled Piper!\" It is a story of an Englisman caught\nin France by the opening of the war, and how on his way back to\nEngland he picks up homeless stray children and brings them with\nhim. Wooly gives the best example of top notch acting that I\nhave seen in years, and the children with him are superb.\nShould youhave the opportunity to see it do not fail to do so.\nIt was so comfortable sitting in an upholstered chair and\nlistening to the accompanyng music that I hated when £The End\"\nflashed on the screen andeveryone filed out. I hadthought the\nmovies wonderful at the gunnery school and there we had sat on\nwooden benches without backs, so that seeing a movie while\nsunk in the luxuory of what was practically a love seat was\nalmost to much.\nMorris tel[L]s me that the theatres have dropped off\nas a result of the ban on motor-cars but he is not worried, says\neverything swings back and forth and they will come back again ,\nif they do not go the other way. I must say that they have done\nwonderfuly and if he did not have to pay such big tadshe would,\nbe ableto put money aside. However I guess that little baby\nwill dispose of any suppluxse[s]. Speaking of taxes I wish\nMiss Finucan would pull herself together and send me mine to\nsign. Also she has never sent meva monthly statement of my\nhooks since November. Appartenly she works on the idea, out\nof sight out of mind. If you see her tell her for Gods sake to\npop up, Muck has sent Morris all his information and she is\nrunning all the theatres besides.\nWe have not he rd a word from Armant so do not\n[End Page 1]\nknow whetehr he is comming out here or not. It. begins to look\nas if again there has been a lot of talk by the Captains and\nnothing comes of it. The more I sec of it all the more I \nrealize that there isea great deal of hot air, and the mbracle\nof it all is that aminltion is being made and planes do come\noff the assembl[y] line.\nDo you remember a man called Reginald Sinclair,\nhe came over on the boat with me and is now the head of\nthe Kaneohe shooting school. He has asked Morris and I\nto go over on Wednesday andshoot Skeet ther[e] and it should\nbe greet fun. Apparently the way they teach the gunners in\nae[r]oplanes to hit things that are moving is to start them off\nwith a shot gun so thatthey get the idea of leading an\nobject. If I shoo_t as badly with a shot gun as I did with\nthe anti aircraft gun I will be disgraced and will be forced\nto hang my head in shame. However the ride over the Pali\nis lovely and the other side of the islandis sox green\nand attrractive that I will rtsk the loss of prestige just\nto see it again.\nMorris bought Guadal Canal Diary yesterday and\nI glanced through it and thought it the best reading I have\nseen in a long time. The discription of how both sides mow\neach other down w th machine gun and tank fire is terrific.\nBut it cannot compare with the march oftime picture we saw at\nthe movie. The fighting in Russia. You cannot believe lt.\nThis was no fake. Men drop ing as they charge. Tanks blo ing UP\nand then you get a close up of soldiers lying dead in the flames\nof the tanks or moving slightly as the flames eat around them.\nOne German is ccmmlng out of a tank with his hands up and as\nhe comes clear they pot him with a tommy gun. Really a ghstly\npicture but it gives you and idea of what war is really like.\nSee it if you can.\nGoodbye dear, with all myx love\nSidney\n[End Page 2]"
