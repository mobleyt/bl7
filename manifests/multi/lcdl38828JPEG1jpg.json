      "value": "As the law was understood until the case of Pinckney and Pinckney, the Debts and Legacies of Wm. Heyward would have been payable out of the residue of his estate without making any distinction between that part of the residue which consists of Bonds and Stocks, and that pact which consists of goods and effects. Still, the authority of the old rule will have weight where the case presents a difference. The lands and negroes are given directly. The lands vest in the Devisees from the Testator's decease: the negroes will vest as soon as the Executors consent to the Legacies. There is no direction to postpone the vesting. There are no trusts declared to authorize the Executors to retain the personal Estate from the devisees of the land, except the declaration of the Testator that his debts and legacies shall be paid out of the crops of his estate in four installments. These words appear to me insufficient to convert the Executors into Trustees, and prevent the estates from vesting. A specific legatee is preferred to a residuary legatee: to deny this would be to destroy all this sense of the distinction, or in other words to say that a residuary legatee is a specific legatee;  [End Page 1] and as the Bonds and Stocks not applied to Debts and Legacies fall into the residue, I am of opinion that the Bonds and Stocks must be first applied, and that the words of the Testators are to be considered according to their effect, and not their literal meaning. That, as he intended to give some specific legacies, he did not intend contrary to the nature of things to postpone the specific to the residuary objects of his County. If the Bonds and Stocks are insufficient, I would consider further of the subject before I would pronounce an opinion as to ulterior payments.  J. L. Petigru  3 May, 1851. [End Page 2] Mr. Petigru's Opinion on the Will of Nathl. Heyward [End Page 3]"
