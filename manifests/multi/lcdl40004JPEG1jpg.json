      "value": "Rusticello 28 June 1839 I am much obliged to you my dear sir for thinking of us in our great distress but still more for remembering us in you prayers and most of all for that kindest wish that the death of poor Susan might be sanctified to the friends and relatives she has left behind. To your prayers I beg to be permitted to join in yours that such an issue may follow that most afflicting dispensation. If poor Susan had been spared only a few months longer I have scarcely a doubt that she would have made a (illegible) religion; for tho' she never told me such was her intention yet from what [fell?] from her in her conversation on the subject, I thought it almost certain that she would do so at no distant day. And her deep convictions of her naturally sinful state; of superadded transgressions; of her total inability of herself to do anything to entitle her to the favor of her Creator; of the all sufficiency and willingness of her saviour; and of the feelings and efficacy of God's grace made me confident in that opinion. Indeed I believe[End Page 1] that nothing has lately kept her from attaching herself to your congregation but timidity and especially the delicacy of her situation. Under such circumstances - with such knowledge and belief - I cannot but hope with you My dear Sir that her gentle spirit has exchanged this world of sin and sorrow for holiness & Heaven. I am (illegible...) Robert has made a profession of religion and hope he may so walk as to adorn it. His views, it was natural to expect, would be cloudy; but I think (illegible) be long before they become clear. When I was in town he seemed anxious about his state; and by an inquiring mind (accompanied by his great sincerity) obscure views will not long be tolerated. Poor fellow, the loss of a wife (and such a wife) and child in one year was enough to make him turn from the world to a (illegible) happiness. May god have mercy on him and bless him and give him peace. Miss Huger - poor young woman- I am grieved? to tell you, will leave us in a few days for the[End Page 2] Virginia Springs. That liver affliction under [which?] she suffered her much last year and which her visit to Philadelphia it was hoped would remove has become worse and therefore it is that she intends trying what the springs do for her. I pray that all her hopes, wishes (MS torn) may be realized. She looks emaciated (illegible) and her spirits are not good. Her complexion is thick and yellow and her appetite slender. Should the Springs do what is expected of them (illegible, MS torn) will return in Sep. or Oct. Her brother (MS torn) younger sister Harriett will go with (MS torn) many thanks for your kindness in writing and for the consolation your letter has given us Eliza joins me in the kindest regards to Mrs Barnwell, yourself and your children- I am My dear Sir grately & sincly yrs Jn L North I recd long ago the book you were so good as to send to me -- pray forgive me for not having told you so before. Tho' late let me beg of you to accept my thanks for it. I have read it once; but I must study it one of these days. (Illegible.... [End Page 3] John L. North June 1839 Revd William H.
