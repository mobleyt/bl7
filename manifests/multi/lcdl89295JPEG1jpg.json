  "description": "A chintz applique, medallion quilt measuring 92.5\" by 91\".  It has a white background with pinks, blues, greens and browns.  And a central motif of a basket of fruit with leaves and bird.  This is encircled by bird, insect and floral appliques.  There are varied floral bouquets at the four sides with fruit, floral and pheasant appliques below. Additional florals, in both baskets and sprays, are outside the center medallion. There is a narrow floral border on both sides of a wider border around the whole quilt. The wide border is a printed floral of bright blue, pink and brown. It is quilted overall in a clamshell design with the border having larger overlapping arcs. The plain muslin backing is in three vertical strips with binding front to back.  The quilt was possibly made in Charleston by Margaret Eliza Darley Seyle Burges, the great, great-grandmother of the donor.  Margaret and James Smith Burges were the parents of Edward Burges.  Edward married Eveline Olivia Petsch.  Their son was Julius Eugene Burges, Sr., who married Anna Willissa Detwiler.  Their son was Julius Eugene Burges, Jr., the donor's father.  The quilt was given in 2010, by Anne Burges Lake.",
