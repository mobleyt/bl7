      "value": "1. Do you agree that a Publication to be issued In September by the Carolina Art  Association about its activities and function should carry a statement about the Survey so far carried out and our intention for its future?  Yes  Do you think several pages in the special \"Power amp; Defense\"  issue of the Post amp; Courier a good medium for a fu  statement of the Survey and plan on which we have been  working ?  Don\"t know Ask Tom Waring.  3. Do you think an exhibition of photographs made for the  Survey; graphs and charts to show growth and expected  growth of the city; exhibits setting forth the need for  planning; materia from other cities to show the value of  planning; would be timey in the fa? Materia from this  exhibit would be used in the above-mentioned artice.  Yes, if there is anyone avaiable to do such a very big and highy specialized job.  4. In your opinion, ought we to emphasize the fact that the  preservation of historic Charleston depends upon the  successfu planning for future Charleston?   Yes, if you can keep this from becoming the issue in another \"Hoy War\" Having been severey wounded in previous wars I have no urge to join in another.  5. should we state in these various announcements that our  committee will be enlarged in the near future?  Perhaps not.  6. should the empoyment of a secretary to assembe information  be continued?   Yes by a means, if possibe, she is dooing [doing] a valuable job.  7. should one of our first objectives be a special and concerted  effort to find means of continuing?  Not anothe [another] appea to the general Public, I hope.  8. should this work be continued as a permanent department of  the Carolina Art Associaltion?  If the matter is brought to the attention of the board and if they want it, then by a means."
