      "value": "26\nJuly 25, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nI received your letters of July 17th. , one\ndated Monday from the colony club and one dated July 20th.\nThe latter was very depressed and I gather that you again\nthink I do not love you and that the world is going to hell.\nThe latter is very likely true, but the former is j st as\nfoolish as ever. I did write you between July third\nand eleventh and tomorrow when I go to the office I will\nlook up the days I wrote you on as I keep a list there.\nHowever you will find that I have not written you between\nthe twentieth and the twenty fifth because I went to sea\non a battleship. Gill Aertson, the boy that we went to\nsee at a cocktail party at the house near Katherines\nis an aide to an admiral. He asked Morris if one of us \nwould like to go on this cruise which would include some\nminor manouevers. Morris was so busy that he told me to\ntake the opportunity so offI went. It was quite remniscent\nof the days on the Guinevere when we use to said the oceans\nwith the Palmers. I reported on board at seven in the\nmorning. Morris dxrove me to the dock and he and I spent\nten minutes arguing which gang plank I shou[l]d go up, as one\nis reserved for officers and the other for men. The one\nfor officers has the officer of the deck at the head and\nyou salute him, present your orders, and say\"report on board\nfor duty sir.\" Well of course I listened to Moonface and\nas a result went up the gang plank for enlisted men. There\nnaturally was no one ot take my orders and the enlisted men\nwere in a turmoil as to what to do with me. Trundling my\nsuitcase I preceded forward and from the stern of a\nbattleship tot he front is a long way. When I had arrived\nI confronted the offcer of the deck from behind and he\nwas so suprised that he allmost fainted as he had been\nwatch[i]ng the gang plank and of course could not understand\nthat an officer in the navy would use the wrong gang plank.\nI asked for Aertson and was sent away with a guide. We went\nthrough rabbit warren after rabbit warren until finally\nin a hole below the surface of the water I found him asleep\nstretching out on his bunk stark naked and dripping perspiration\nat the rate of a gallon a minute in the terrific heat.\nBattleships do no have any port holes so there is only the\noriginal air that was enclosed at the time of building and\na strange smelling substance that everyone assured me was\npumped in from the outside[,]but that smelled like old rubber\nto my not too delicate nostrils. I awoke my host and\nafter dressing we both went to the ward room for breakfast\nBy this time I to was wringing wet and mopping my brow with\na saturated handerchief. From breakfast we went up on what\n[End Page 1]\nis known as the fl g deck. It is called this I am certain\nbecause I do not think anything else could survive there\nvery long as there is absolutely noth ng to sit down on.\nI walked the deck like Nelson from seven thirty to elecen\nthirty[,]between moments [scratched through] I was pressing myself against\nthe railings to let Captains and Admirals pass. Then my\nfeet hurt so much that I climbed into a little chair that\nwas jutting out form the railing l ke a window bo[x]. I had\na premonition that it was something special as no one used\nit all morning and certainly there must have been other\nacking feet besides my own. Down I sand in this haven of\ncomfort, lifted my aching puppies up from the deck and sighted.\nI did not have time to finish the sigh before I was plucked \nout of my seet and\nwarned never to do that again as that was the admirals seat.\nBack I went to pacing with many a thought of the soft chairs\non the mainland. At twelve e went below for luxnchoen and\nhad a soup watered with perspirations and other goodies. I was\nsleepy and asked where I was supposed to sleep and received\nthe startling answer that there was not any bed for me they\nwere all occupied but that we would see what would turn\nup during the course of the day. Back I went to pacing the\ndeck my feet crying out pitifuly at each step, until suddenly,\nI was almost blwon off them completely by a broadside of cannon.\nAfter that I did not bother who I talked to as I could not hear\nwhat they said anyway. When the guns were not going off loud\nspearkers were urging men and officers to go here and there.\nThe man giving the orders had never learned to speak English\nbut I was told that after several months on board you pick up\nhis language and can understand him, although no one has ever\nlearned to speak as well and with the same inflection as he.\nHe sounds like a train announcer t the grand central with a\nbad cold. We went through terrfice manouvers gainst an\nimaginary enemy . It was like rushing around on one side of\na tennis net making terrific shots, serving, ground strokes\netc. wi hout any opponent. or balls. At six we went down for\ndinner and then back to pacing until eleven when I was informed\nI was to sleep on the Captain sofa in his cabin. I immediately\nwent there, stri[p]ped off my clothes and lay down on the leather\nsofa. Sweated like a pig, have you ever laid on bare leather\nwithout any clothes on. It sticks to you like a saddle to the\nstrappings of your bre[T]tches. I had hardly fallen asleep before\nthe loud speekers heard of ti and went off with a bang. They\nare always g[iv]ing some order and when there is nothing else to do\nthey shout \"pipe the sweepers\". This means that all the unlisted\nmen g[r]ab their brooms and start sweeping. The next morning I \nwas awakned at qu rter to five and the day was repeated except\nthat I tried to go down and sit on the main deck under one of\nthe big guns and get a little rest. I had hardly been there\nten seconds before those ghastly louxd speakers found me and\nroared\"clear the decks. \" I tumbled down a hatch , and grouped\nmy way to my frinxds cabin hoping to lie on his bed and sleep.\nHowe er he had been on watch all night before so he was already\nin bed and had ac uired a nice coat of perspiration by time I\narrived. Back I went to the deck and paced back and forth.\n[End Page 2]\nAside from this side of it the cruise was intensely interesting\nI learned a great deal about the conditions the men live under\nthe typed of information they wanted form our office and what\nthey thought of things we had already published. The officers\nand men were exce[e]dxingly nice and some of them the most attra-\nctive I have ever met. The ship was run beautifuly and was\nclean as a pin and the manouvers gave you a great deal of\nconfidence in our Navy and the men who run it.\nYou know how you have thought that I never have\ntried to get you out here or made an effort to have leave.\nI wrote you that there is not to be anymore leave until the\nwar is over. Today we received an order that men who ask \nfor a transfer of service to some other station of branch of\nthe service will be regarded as attmepting a subterfuge to\nreturn to the mainland and will be treated accordingly. If\nI only could impress upon you to things,\n1. I love you just ast much\n2. I tried all channels to get you out here and\nthere was'nt a pray.\nI think you would be much happier. In your new position sweet\nheart stop worrying about whether I love you and try to\nhave a good time. You will receive this letter at your\nnew address and I send with it all my love and best wishes.\nYour cable saying you were telephoning tomorrow night\nwas waiting for me on my return. I look forward so\nmuch to talking to you dea[r].\nSidney J Legendre\nP.S Today is sunday, I worked at the\noffice so have no news of the beach\nAt the office morning: I wrote you on July 1,3,5,9,10,11,12,14,17,19,20\nand today the 25th.\n[End Page 3]"
