      "value": "M 6 6 43\nR 6 10 43\nJune 5th\nDear Sidney,\nIt is nine o'clock Saturday evening and I am sitting in Rose's\nbed room where the air conditioner works so that I can write to you.\nYou c an not immagine the heat to-day -it seems almost worse than at any time\nlast year, maybe because it is the first few weeks of it and I am not yet\naccustomed to it. My office was 98 all day and we sat in pools of water.\nLandine Melle. and I had supper in the garden but it felt no better than the house.\nOne of those really miserable evenings. Your lovely flowers have arrived and Ihav\nthem all in here beside me where it is cool and they will keep. Big enormous floppy  \npeonies, pink snapdragons[,] and blue cornflowers. They are so lovely sweet heart\nand I love so thinking that they come from you.\nThe mails once more have momentarily let up,and I have had no word\nfor a week. Maybe to-morrow the postman will bring me one. I hope so.\nLast night Margaret Griggs gave a dinner in her garden for Hampton\nBarnes and Evvie was so thrilled and excited it was delightful. We sat in the gardn\ntill after 1.30 A.M. The latest I have been up in Washington. Harry Ho[p]kins and Loui[s,]\nthe Duy Gates' Russ Forgan, and loads of others I did not know. We just sat at\nour tables and talked till we thoughtmwe had all better go home to our hot houses.\nI thought how beautiful it would have been if the party had been in Honolulu, and\nwe could have looked at the sea, and smelt the flowers, instead of leaning against\nthe neighbors back fence and sweltering on our party chairs. All these Georgetown\ngardens are small but it certainly is better than sitting indoors.\nI tried to paly tennis this evening with Reggie Winn in the park at\nthe top of the hill but all the courts were taken and the players were so selfish\nand rude they had no thought of relinquishing their courts,although they had palyed\nfor an hour[,]so we came home and called it a day.\nI am going out to Chevey Chase again to morrow with Landine and hope\nto find a game of tennis when I get out there. I dont know any of the playing\nmembers so can not arrange it in advance. However I am sure I can get a game.\nI really have no news darling to tell you. The office Job grindes on\nand there continues to be talk of people getting overseas, but [I] dont know. I\nceratinly would like to leave the Washington summer beh_ind me and go anywhere.\nIf only it could be Hawaii. It seems that portion of the country is not going to\nopen for us for a long time, and I dont know when I can get out there. I might get\nto London which would be more interesting than this place anyway[,] andmceratinly not\nas hot. However I really put no faith in any of it as nothing yet had materialised\nin anything I thought I was going to do,\nThe strikes continue although it seems the situation is going to\nbe better as a bill has been passed to make strikes elegal. I dont know why they\ndid not pass it years ago when all this began. It makes everyone so mad to thinkt\nthey can get away w[i]th it when everyone else is having a tough time and these people\nare living on the fat of everything. Its just a disgrace. \"Shocking\" as Carole\nwould say.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nHampton Barnes tells me that out there in the Pacific you really get very little\nnews of what goes on anywhere else. Dont you want me to send you the Sunda[y] papers\nonce a week or is that not possible? The Submarine warfare is really improving.\nSubs are really being sunk which is the most encourraging news of all. I think\nthe European picture will be an impressive one this summer[,]and I certainly hope\nwe get this inv_asion successfully over with in the not too distant future.\nI am really looking forward to my trip the week end of the 12th\nwhen I go to watch Hill with the children to settle them for the summerin their\ncottage. The thought of a swim really thrills me. It is so exciting to think of\nlying on a beach if for only a day. It will be the most wonderful thing I have done I\nsince the last time you and I were together there nearly a year ago. That is last\ntime I have been in the sea. Think of it! Well my darling I hope as time goes byy \nyou dont love me any less,or miss me any less,or forget me any more. Its alot to\nhope for when we are so far away for so long. Maybe some day we can make up for\nall this lost time, these empty days and these dreary nights. I hope so.\nI am afraid my letters must be getting so dull to read. I never p\nam able to tell you anything pleasant and delightful.Just dinner parties. There\nis little else to look forward to frankly other than meeting new f_aces[,]and hearing\nnew thoughts, and new war angles[,]and news. Its the stimulas after working hours.\nNext Wednesday I have Director Hobby, Miss Charlotte, and an\nAir Marshal Welsh comming for dinner. I keep inviting my Boss the General but he\nseems always too tied up to accept.\nRose has gone to New York to buy groceries for the house at\nWatch Hill[,]and get things organized to ship up there. I dont know what I would\ndo without her. She does everything. A really wonderful person.\nThe children took a picnicx supper last night and ate it in the\npark as it was cooler. I joined them up there for an hour and it was really so ple-\nasant after the heat of the office. They thought it hot which amused me. I wish thy\ncould feel my room where I sit,\nWell my sweetheart I have no lovely discriptions to charm you \nwith, or amusing anecdotes to tell. Josephine- our Jo is back from London and I\ndont believe she covered herself with glory either.\nLoads of love to you my darling. I think of you so much[,]and\nlove you so much.\nHoney is here besides me and he looks more like Clippy every day.\nBo loves him and pulls him about and it does not bother him at all. He just thumps\nthat long tail of his[,]and looks foolish and pleased. He is a sweet doddles and Iam\nso glad he is going north with the children. It was one reason for taking the\ncottage. He is a lovely animal and I cant tell you what an ache in the heart he giv[e]\nme- he is so Clippiish.\nI have no Plantation news as Miss Fanucan writes practically not  \nat all.\nAll love sweet ears.Love to Morris too.\nGertie.\nI met Alice Longworth the other night and we had a knockdown drag out battle of w\nwords. What a woman! She attacked Foxcroft[,]and I attcked her[,]and we went to town.\nShe just tries to be clever and amusing at anyones expense. A real monster I though[t.]\n[End Page 2]"
