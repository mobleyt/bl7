      "value": "Edingsville. Dec. 4th 1870. Dear Mary. Ive put aside my sewing to have a nice chat and tell You how much Pleasure Your letter gave me. especially too as You kindly offered to forgive my [shaby?] behavior, which was altogether unintentional. Cousin Catherine’s letter brought doleful reports of You, fear You’ve been ill treating Your self to induce chills so late in the season, Mary? I become more & more disgusted, Each day with our climate have had so many cases of shattered constitutions around me this summer. So far our sea shore home has proved quite a success, & these bright days the view is magnificent, Our Plans for the coming year are at a stand still, Papa is trying to arrange[End Page 1] matters that he may plant one of the finest Plantations on the Isle, if he succeeds we will of course remain where we are during the Year & with Spring when the whether is mild & Pleasant, & the R.R finished, Can’t you pay us a visit. Mama says you know all about our maroon life & must come prepared. if Papa can accomplish his object, perhaps I’ll return with You & divide the time with Aunt Emma & Yourselves. Often we think of picking up & running off to Savannah but our Scheme is interwoven with difficulties, Mary my next door neighbor is one of your Columbia school mates. Juliette Eding who asks Constantly after You & wants to know if You remember her? she is not at all interesting & as green as[End Page 2] a cabbage, is blessed with two illustrious Young Brothers, who, follow closely in her foot steps,, You’ve no doubt heard Many jokes about these Edistonians, too laughable to credit, but I assure You Mary, they far exceed any account I’ve heard. As a class they are disgusting society in a miserable state, & nothing could induce one to spend my days here, We’ve sent [Illegible] to the Boat for [Aunt?] Addie, who meant to pay us a visit on her way to Beaufort but concluded, she could not make it convenient, so no doubt is with Aunt [Emma?], I Envy You seeing her. I hear frequently from my “Baltimore Parents” who insist on my returning, suppose You go in my Place Mary? know You would have a real jolly time Mr Wyman is devoted[End Page 3] to plump girls, tho! no doubt in Your conflict with chills You will come out beautifully less -- & will scarcely be recognizable. Ma insists I’m diminishing, & truly tis time, but I can’t notice it Yet. I am so sorry You are compelled to give up Your nice house. Your long sojourn, must give You all a home like feeling, & I do feel so much for Cousin Catherine in loosing her nice garden, tho’. Allard writes he has a nice plan ahead in fixing her another & I’m sure with her Energy and [turn?], she’ll be quite in love with it. Allard, writes in fine spirits; tho works very hard & seems to find the C. a charming family. Wouldn’t You Enjoy a peep at Nancie’s 12 pounder, Belle must be a lovely little soul We see nothing at all of Georgia[End Page 4]"
