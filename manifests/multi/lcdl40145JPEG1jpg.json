      "value": "20th May 1846 My dear Brother I write you a few hasty lines. Stuart Hanckel has written to know what I did with a catechism for the religious instruction of the negroes, given by him to me to be read and returned to him during the sitting of our convention in Charleston. I remember the catechism perfectly well, but my impression is that I gave it to you with a request that you should send it to Stuart. I have not been able to find it among my papers. Do you recollect it and is it with you? Do have a search made for it and send it to Stuart. I am confident that it was not brought to Beaufort. I am only doubtful whether I left it in your charge or only in yr house somewhere. We are all well here, poor Abraham has got back [illegible], but, I fear only to die. We sympathize very much in your disappointment, with respect to the return of Mr Fowles. With my means of information I still think that the enterprise should be prosecuted but perhaps God will order circumstances so as to guide you safely through this difficulty. May God keep your mind in peace, a few[End Page 1] years, and we shall know him even as we are known. I have just remitted $400 on aid of schools in China and hope soon to remit $200 more the amt of our annual contribution to that object. If you write to Dr Boone, say to him that I wish that he would for the benifit [sic] of this part of his charge, make some specific statement as to the prospects of the school. Some thousands of dollars are contributed in this country specifically for that object and I do not perceive it alluded to in his communications. With love to Catherine and all of your family, And kind remembrance to our friends. As ever yr affectionate Brother RWBarnwell Re Wm H Barnwell[End Page 2] To The Revnd Wm. H. Barnwell Charleston So. Ca.[End Page 3]"
