      "value": "23\nJuly 17, 1943\nDear Gertie, \nHow are the plans coming along for the big invasion. You are\nproxbably having Rose pack everything into trunks, take them out again\nbecause the trunks or trunk is too heavy and starting at the beggining\nagain. I know how difficult it is to have to try and bring clothes for\nhot and cold weather, dinning out and day use and my sympathy goes out to\nyou. Uniforms are so easy. One always wears the same thing, and there\nis never the necessity to change or worry whether you are looking your\nbest. You have the rather dubious satisfaction of knowing that you are\nalways looking your worse.\nThe road system being constructed from Honolulu to the Navy Yard\nfascinates me. The only possible way that it could hare been conceived is\nthat they gave a very drunken man a pencil and paper and asked him to\ndraw a system of interlocking roads that would cause as many accidents as\npossible. While the accidents are ssured there is the extra thrill of\nseeing the lengths that they have gone to in order that cars shall meet\nsuddenly without any warning in sideways collisions, while some of the\narrangements for bang up head on crashes are superb. Even with bad luck and\nfew cars on the road, a condition that obviously will not occur out here,\nthe daily take should be at least one hundred accidents. Just before you arrive a\nat the Navy Yard there is a hinterland of cross roads a veritible jungle of\ninterlacing highways bisected by a railroad. This is indeed the happy\nHunting Ground, and a tractor and crane are kept in constant attendance\nto lift the wrecks up and remove them form the scene. Into this wild melee\nwe plunge every morning in the little red car. To the tune of rasping fenders\nand the shrill high not[e]of interlocking bumbers we go under and over the\ntop of everything. If you were only here for one mornings ride, you would\ndecorate all of the Passengers with the congressional medal for outstanding\nbravery in the face of the greatest possible danger to life and limb.\nLast night Duke Kohanamoku asked us to dinner or rather supper.\nWe had just finished swimming and were about to go home and cook when he\nsaid come on back and have spaggetti with me. It was a most delightful evening.\nHis wife Nadine, who is very nice, cooked the spaggetti and a wonderful sauce\nof meet and tomatoes while Duke gathered tiny little tomatoes in his victory\ngarden. By the time the spaggetti was ready we had pured the tomatoes ontop\nof [the] lettuce and all sat down with a bottle of red wine and the biggest plates\nof spaggettiX you have ever seen. We were gathered around a tiny table in the\nkitchenand ocassionaly I found myself at one end of a strin of Spaggettin and\nMorris at the other end. There was also a cat that Duke said followed\n[End Page 1]\nhim everywhere, but I did not c sider this a comp liment as it was the\nra[t]ties looking cat I have ever seen. The body was white and the tail and\ncarts were black. Depending on what he was leaning up against you thought\nit was a cat without a tail and ears or a cat with only two ears and tail and\nno body. After dinner Nadine showed us pictures of Duke while he washed\nthe dishes dressed in a lava lava. You know one of those gay colored clothes\nwrapped around the waist.\nThere were pictures of him in his racing days. At one time he\nheld something like twelve world records. You have never seen such a physique\nin your life. Really beautiful. Then there were hilarious picutres of\nhim when he was acting in the moveis. Dressed as a deep sea diver, a Turk,\nan indian in a massere of the cowboys etc. He told a story of how he was\nsupposed to be an Indian Chief and was all dressed up in a bigh head dress\nof feathers. Riding to the top of a hill he peered out with hand shaded eyes.\nDown below he saw the enemy. United States Troups. Waving to his tribesmen\nwho were still down below the surface of the ridge on the fa r side he\nstarted down to meet his foes. All of a sudden there was a roar of hoofs\nand he found he was behind his five hundred tirbesmen who had galloped\npast. The director stopped the scene and told him that while it was\nprobably the thing to do in war to be behind his troops nevertheless\nin the movies an Indian Chief had to be at the head of his attacking braves.\nDuke also described how some of the movies were made showing fights between\na man and a shark. The shark was in a big pool of water and the man\nnext to the pool but not in it. The camera was located on the far side of\nthe pool so that it took thepicutre through the water. The man who was\nnot in water at all wonderful passes at the shark when he swam up to the\nglass to see what was going on. This man would fall on his hack. Jump up\nin the air and wave his knife etc. and it all looked OK when the picure was [scratched through]\nshown. The picutres were all very amusing that he showed us because they\nwere of moving picutrex actresss and men back in 1913. Anita Stewart etc.\nYou have never seen such funny looking clothes in all your life. I had\nforgotten that people ever dressed like that. Also I really belive that\nwomen have changed their shapes since those days. At that time they all\nhad b[ig] stomacks, funny figures etc. Then there [were] pictures of the days\nin Honolulu before the war. Days when the islands were crowded with movie\nstars and notables. He told stories of the wealth that was poured out.\nMen and women would ask the beach boys what they wanted. No matter what they\nasked for they were given. He told of one man, a co per king who went out\nin a canoe with some of the boys and when they had come ashore said what\nwould you like. One said a guitar, another a camera and a third, a house and\ngarden. Each received what he had asked for. The sky was the limit.\nCan you imagine how spoiled those bo[y]s were and the trouble that\neveryone had with them.\nGoodbye sweeheart, hope I hear from you soon, although I must\nsay I received a lettcr on the twelth, so I have no kick coming. All my\nlove.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
