      "value": "Charleston April 20th 1866 Maj T. B. Ferguson Dean Hall Dear Sir On Monday last, I made enquirey respecting the labor required, DeLarge (spelling doubtful) reported yesterday that he could not get Rice hands, but could in the course of a few weeks supply the Mill hands, and could probably get enough this week to keep the mill running, but for good hands would have to pay $15 pr month and rations. Three of the names given in your letter of the hands that came to town have agreed to return tomorrow at the above rate and have signed an agreemt. to that effect a copy of which you will receive enclosed. They would not agree for the balance of the year, lest the place might prove unhealthy, but the greemt. is to continue from month to month unless one weeks previous notice be given. I have not made any enquirey respecting the flats required. but hope to do so tomorrow or Monday. I have seen Mr Whaley. He says the break in the dam, he repaired, was in No. 5 mill pond field. Your brother with whom I spoke as the best method of preserving the bank, or rather of protecting the weak point, thought the slabs from the mill might be used advantageously or an old hulk filled with bats &c might be moored against it, to form a breakwater at the point where the force (written in side margin-) Two only of the names in your letter are to the agreemt. the third is a brother of the two Smalls named-- [End Page 1] of the current is strongest. You will no doubt embrace the opportunity his visit affords of consulting him on this and other matters connected with the work, after which, I will be pleased to hear from you further. I do not mean to question your own judgment on the premises, but his greater experience will no doubt be taxed for suggestions. I mentioned to your brother that I had been approached for the purpose of knowing if the place was for Sale, and that I had replied, my arrangements with you, would prevent a sale unless with a condition for giving possession on the 1st Janry next the party then inquired, if your arrangements could not be assumed by him in the event of any agreement. Your brother will probably speak with you on this matter also. I fear however the views of the party and mine are too far apart as to the value of the place, for us to come to an agreement if all obstacles were out of the way. Mr Shokes called this morning with your letter of 17th and postscript of 18th. He says the work will not be done at Easons until Saturday consequently he will not get off before Monday. He has bought all the articles at Cameron Barkley & Co except the Flour, Homespun and [illegible], which Mr Gillespie will attend to. Mr Shokes will see Mr. Roff respecting the pully. He has selected a portion for the cog wheel which will be cast on Saturday. I went to Gravelys to buy the Doubletrees and chains, but found he could give me no definite information respecting the kind suitable. I therefore went out to take an observation [End Page 2] of the arrangements of a government pair of wheels and found attached to the 5th chain, two stretchers, to which the swingletrees or singletrees, were attached, thus relieving [illegible] the weight of the doubletree as per diagram. I will send you this arrangement by first boat. unless you order differently in your next. I believe there is nothing further to be said at this time Your Respy Wm. McBurney [diagram depicting \"5th chain,\" \"chain,\" \"wood,\" \"chain\"] *this crop piece is a stick to keep the chains apart. [End Page 3]"
