      "value": "812 Lexington Ave\nNew York 21\nNov 4th 1944\nDear Mrs Legendre,\nImagine our dismay when we heard of your\nbad luck; the news was broadcast on the shortwave from Berlin\nOct 20th, I think [of] you every minute and wonder how you manage\nto pass the time, just as soon as your camp number comes\nthrough I will send some warm underwear; and something for\ndiversion such as knitting [and books]. I know your letters are limited but\ndo let us know just as soon as you can what you would like\nmost and I will endeavor to send it. The children are very\nwell and was delighted to see their Daddy. We made his Birthday\nas cheery as possible. Nancy and Morris came to dinner after\nwhich they took Landine to a theatre. The idea of going out \nat eight gave her more of a thrill than the actual theatre.\nShe likes her school I take her in the mornings and fetcher her in\nthe evenings as the Buses have been discontinued.\nBoth the children have joined the ice skating club\nand are enjoying it a lot. L. is marvellous considering she\nhas been so few times on ice skates. This week end she\nhas gone to the country with a school chum, and next week-\nend expects to go to the [illegible] - quite socially inclined, eh!\nMrs. Fraser was in town two weeks ago and came to see the\nchildren; needless to say she and all your friends are\nmaking constant inquiries. I received your letter with key\nenclosed ages ago - but up to the present the trunk has not\narrived. Honey is looking very well in spite of city life\nhe sends you a wag of the tail. I will write again soon;\nin the meantime I trust you are keeping fit; and we will\nall be so glad to see you; trusting that pleasure is not too\nfar distant. Love and all kind thoughts. [Yours] faithfully. Rose."
