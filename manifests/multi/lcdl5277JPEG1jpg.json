  "description": "Picturing the Bridge. The story of the Cooper river bridge as told in the special editions of the Charleston newspapers was rendered vivid by the wealth of illustrations in those publications, showing progress of the work on the great structure from the beginning to the moment of opening. These pictures will make interesting history and will doubtless be shown in years to come by many of those who participated in the jubilation of yesterday and will be keen to tell of the celebration to the youngsters who will take it all for granted that there is a driveway across the Cooper for their cars. The engineers and builders of the bridge, as, indeed, all of the officers of the corporation which owns and of the contractors who built it, cooperated in every possible way with the newspapers in the making of the special editions complete records of the work and of the occasion celebrated at the opening, and to them The Evening Post expresses its appreciation and thanks. Especially is it under obligations to Mr. E. L. Durkee, engineer of the McClintic-Marshall Company, for putting at its disposal his extensive collection of photographs of the work during the various stages of its progress. The pictures tell the story of the bridge as no verbal description could and there are virtually no significant phases of the work which escaped Mr. Durkee's camera. To have had access to this collection was the good fortune of The Evening Post and of the public to whom it was enabled to present them.;Newspaper clipping (6.5\" x 2\") from the Charleston Evening Post, titled \"Picturing the Bridge.\"",
