      "value": "Combahee 4th Jan 1817 My Dear Mother, I really feel mortified when I think how long it is since I have written to you- but I have neglected to write by the post, in consequence of our being in daily expectation of seeing your boat, which has not yet arrived. I received your letter by old Harry, and was glad to hear that you were all quite well.- Sarah has indeed been fortunate in her confinement, and I hope is now riding out. I begin to feel very anxious to see you all again, but can't say exactly when it will suit, - I don't know how Mrs. Pinckney could have heard that I was to stay with you during the Races, as I don't recollect saying so, but I should like to do it very much.- however as I was with you all the Summer dear Mother, I really wish that you would begin to think of paying us a visit. Edward would soon know you, and you would really be amused with him just now, as he attempts to say, and do, every thing,- and if he only had his Aunt Betsy with him, would talk in the course of a week. Nat has got [End Page 1] quite well again, but not the sign of a tooth, which makes me a little uneasy, as I believe that children who cut their teeth so late, generally suffer most. Mr. Heyward goes to Charleston on Monday, to be present at Miss Heywards wedding, which takes place on Tuesday.- I have not yet determined whether I shall stay here alone, or accept my Mothers invitation to stay with her. The latter is much the most agreeable plan, but not the most prudent; as I have been moving about so much lately, that my work has been quite neglected, and has now become very pressing,- but as I am not remarkable for doing what is right, I suspect my work will be thrown aside, 'till a more convenient time. We have been very gay in this part of the world during the last week, - Miss [R..?] has paid our neighborhood a flying visit [escorted by her beau Mr. Morris, which induced Mrs. Radcliffe to give a dinner party, yesterday, at which all our neighbours were present; and we spent a very pleasant day.- I dine every where and leave Nat at home, with his old Nurse, who says that he does not miss me at all, but he takes care to make up for it at night. Thank Mary for my [?], though I have not yet receiv'd them, also my other [End Page 2] friends.- Elizabeth really has a sweet little child, she was rather cross while they stay'd here, but I supposed it to be in consequence of the journey.- I dosed her directly with Magnesia [and] Rhubarb, [your sovereign remedy] which appear'd to be of great service- Elizabeth looked very thin and pale, but not as badly as I did with Edward. Mr. Heyward desires to be affectionately remembered to you all, and with my love to some, and a good scold to the rest, I remain dear Mother, Your Affec. Child, Hetty B Heyward [page torn]... close you the change for [page torn] ...Hogs-- [End Page 3] Mrs. Mary Barnwell. Beaufort. [End Page 4]"
