      "value": "New York April 4th 1843. Revd W. H. Barnwell, Dear Brother, On the 1st inst. I wrote Mr Desaussure, giving information of the receipt of letters from Brother Boone confirming the Sad intelligence of the death of his wife. Our afflicted Brother did not State many particulars, but refered (sic) us to a letter to Mr DeSaussure, & Stated that he had requested him to furnish us a copy. I wish to have a Biographical account of Mrs B in the next number of the Spirit of Missions and would beg of you dear Brother to furnish me with it, if possible, without any delay. Hers was indeed a [right?] example and a useful life-- Though dead She may yet Speak to the living. Dear Brother Boone is greatly Supported-- God be thanked his faith does not fail. He may return to bring his children, but not to remain He Says he never felt a Stronger desire to live an die in his Masters service in China. Your kind communication of the 15 Feb was[End Page 1] duly recd-- many thanks for it and the \"sermons\". As the materials for the annual report must be collected in May, and as in other accounts I must be much in N.Y during that month, I shall not be able to visit Charleston before the meeting of the Board, though I have a yearning desire towards you. I was elected only for this interval-- I am not yet prepared to Say whether, if the Board desire it, I Shall be willing to continue in this position. I love pastoral duty-- there is a great deal that is Secular in my present duties-- and nothing but a conviction of the [leadings?] of [Providence?] this way, will keep me here. Of course therefore I cannot Say whether it will be in my favor to accept your invitation for October-- but with your permission, I can transfer it to my Successor Should one be appointed. The liberal benefactions we have recd from Charleston, & the Spirit manifested among you are most cheering to us-- and now I will add Something that will be most cheering to you. A few weeks since we recd from an anonymous Source, but through a responsible Channel, a pledge for the half support, Say $1500, of three additional Missionaries [illegible] to China, on condition that the other half be also [End Page 2] pledged from a responsible Source. This Second pledge was recd a few days Since from Mr Appleton, Merchant, Boston-- so that now it only needs that the right sort of men offer for the work. I intend, (D.V.) to meet the Society for [Missry?] inquiry at the [Semy?] this [Evg?] for the purpose of reading Dr Boone's letters and of making known the above pledges. Let our [illegible: page torn] prayers be offered that the right men may be Specially found. [illegible: page torn] no other in your neighborhood, like [illegible: page torn] with Boone? Dr B has Sent us a long list of [medicine?] which it is very desirable for him to have. It will be in great part forwarded to him by a vessel that Sails to day-- But he adds that any quantity of [illegible] that can be Sent (even that which is called [illegible] which answers an excellent purpose) will be most acceptable-- Medical Skill, & the relief the [Missy?] are able to afford to the Sick, add greatly to their influence. I mention this because if you have druggists in your city who feel an interest in the Cause, they might [provide?] it by donating of, especially Quinine Blue Pill Magnesia Powdered Rhubarb [Julep?] Blue Ointment Rochelle Salts Senna Epsom Salts Sulphur Tartaric Acid [illegible] of [illegible] Caustic (silver) Cream of Tartar Bicarbonate of Soda Peruvian Bark Spanish flies--[End Page 3] Extract from Mr Boone's letter \"The Stock of medicines on hand could I fear be exhausted before we can receive help from America & entreat that every dispatch may be used in forwarding those which are enumerated in this list. The ladies in Charleston who have so liberally Contributed towards the school for Chinese boys, will I have no doubt, as there is no school at present rejoice to have the funds they have contributed applied to the relief of the sick & suffering Whenever, dear Brother, you may visit N.Y. you shall have a hearty welcome at the house of Yours affctly Jas W. Cooke [written on side of page:] Jas. W. Cooke April 4th -- 1843-- Rev W H Barnwell Charleston S C-- Single paid[End Page 4]"
