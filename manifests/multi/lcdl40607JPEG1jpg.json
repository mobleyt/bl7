      "value": "New York Sept. 23 1834 My dear Daughter, When I left Boston, (a week ago) it was my intention to have travelled on as far as Norfolk, & if no good opportunity by water offered, to take the stage for George Town & Charleston about the middle of Oct--Since my arrival here, I have seen in the papers, such gloomy accounts from Carolina, the great destruction of crops by a gale on the 4th inst. & the near approach of that [dread?] disease cholera to our city & country. I feel anxious beyond measures to return with all possible speed--accordingly, [have?] taken my passage in the ship [A?] Allen, to sail on Saturday the 27th inst.-- While in Boston, I received two letters from you, I need not say, what great happiness they afforded me--& particularly, that, you were all so fortunate as to escapte unhurt, from the breaking down of our carriage--as you may not receive this, I shall make it short--James & Harleston were well when I left them--James will go to Carolina about the last of October, & will enter the College at Columbia in December--I have received no letter from home, since the 1st of Sept--they were all well at that time--there is still cholera in this place, 93 deaths the week [End Page 1] ending the 22nd inst-- My love to Mary & Mr. Memminger--I am quite well, & hope you are all the same-- Your fond Father W. Wilkinson [End Page 2] Miss Anna Bella Wilkinson Philadelphia Pa Va [End Page 3]"
