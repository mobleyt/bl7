      "value": "New York Oct. 17, 1843 Rev. & dear Sir I [beg?] to offer my thanks for the kind aid you have rendered me in my present effort for the relief of my diocesan institutions-- in the sum remitted by you to N.Y. The Rev. Mr Lounsbury has gone within a few days, as an agent of mine, for the same cause, to D.C. & Georgia-- I beg to commend him to your kind counsel & aid-- He will at once make himself known to you on reaching Charleston-- I sent to you a few days since a [copy?] of my charge-- As you are about setting up a paper, could you not do something by that means for me, viz -- by keeping up a little fire [upon?] my object only-- as by publishing part of my appeal & of [my?] charge-- making yourself an agent for receiving my donations? In the last Churchman are two [End Page 1] articles, one editorial, the other communicated, & the last supposed to be from Bp. O-- intended to shut me out from the aid of the people of N.Y-- And certainly on account of the position I have taken, as a matter of duty, & am not sorry for, in regard to the Carey ordination & the heresy of Puseyism in general. I have many adversaries here-- How far I shall be hindered, I cannot say-- But I think such opposition may be & ought to be used to wake up those who think [I?] as I do, but who do not come up to my help (such as in any laymen who are well able to help, but need to be aroused to the object)-- The consideration ought be put in this way in substance-- So Bp. Mc-- because he has done so & so, to be unsuccessful? Will Protestants allow it? Ought not the opposition to arouse the greater effort to help him? Shall the institutions in Ohio perish because Bp. Mc-- has done his duty? [&c?] I offer these hints, that in your paper, you may serve me, should it strike you favourably-- My charge is stereotyped by the [Harpers?]-- They sell it at $8.00. the hundred-- Some persons here are purchasing for gratuitous distributions-- Should it seem to you calculated to be [End Page 2] useful & should you obtain the means to purchase, the Harpers would send any number you should order-- I have no pecuniary interest in it. With affectionate regards, I remain Your obliged friend & brother Chas P. McIlvaine My address-- Sands Fox & Co 59 Pine St N.Y. [End Page 3] Bp McIlvaine Oct. 1843. Rev. Mr Barnwell Charleston S.C.
