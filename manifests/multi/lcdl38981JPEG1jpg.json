      "value": "Wateree S C   27th March 1866.   Dear Cousin James   It is my sad duty to inform you of the death on the 23d inst. of my Father, whose illness has continued as you are aware, to be a source of serious anxiety to his family for the last four months.   His disease terminated in a sudden congestion of the brain, and he breathed his last, after being asleep, and totally unconscious for ten hours.   He was buried in Columbia last Sunday at Trinity Church where the members of his family and our friends were present to follow his remains to the tomb.   I find myself and Gabriel Manigault left Executors by the Will. dated 2d Janry '66.   I go to Charleston tomorrow to qualify and &c-   My Father has left his entire property to be divided equally between my Sister Elizabeth and myself. The division to be made by his Executors.   That portion left my Sister is placed in Mr Bee's care, as Trustee; and free from any debts of Mr Trapier-   Margaret Hays is left to be cared for  [End Page 1] by his Executors during her life time.   The totally changed condition of affairs at present seems to have prevented my Father from making any more specific apportionment of his estate, and by such an arrangement the duty of his Executors, will be comparatively easy. They, having full power to divide the property of every description without going into any court-   I am glad to hear that your prospects are more encouraging at Combahee. Affairs are very doubtful up here and it looks very much like child play- From all parts of the South I learn that the labour of the blacks is very trifling. and over the entire cotton country, hardly more than a half crop planted, and the negroes apparently gone away. I am afraid the result will be very serious over the whole country next year both North and South-   Hoping you continue well, I am with love to the boys   Very Affec   Yr Cousin   Jas B. Heyward Esqr E. Barnwell Heyward  [End Page 2]"
