  "description": "Letter from William McBurney in Charleston to Thomas B. Ferguson at Dean Hall Plantation concerning the hiring of freedmen.  McBurney writes that after a survey of other Cooper River plantation owners he finds that most are offering a share of the crop instead of monthly pay \"whether from a want of ability to pay wages or because they believed an interest in the crop would secure a more steady course of labor and prevent stealage.\"  McBurney informs Ferguson that he has written up a contract and submitted it to General Scott at the Freedmen's Bureau for acceptance.  He fears the general will alter his submitted contract in favor of the former slaves and writes that officials in the bureau think the \"freedman and the white northern laborer\" are the same.  2p. February 1, 1866.",

      "value": "Charleston Feby 1st 1866. Mr T. B. Ferguson Dear Sir Your favor of 30th ult. was received this morning and contents noted. I have purchased the Lacing leather Stock and die plate and the parcel containing them will go up tomorrow viz if the R.R. agent will take them on board in the morning. Your letter came too late in the day to have them sent up before 3 O'clk PM today. I learned today at Cameron B & Co that the Mill has been here for two weeks and that your brothers firm was informed of it, if so they have no doubt informed you, as they are generally very prompt in giving attention to business. I am sorry to learn that you have had trouble with the work done by Mr Darcy and hope you have seen the extent of it, and applied the remedy. I notice your remarks respecting the freedmen on the place, occupancy of houses at pleasure &c and consequent uncomfortable feeling. After receiving your views of a contract dated 16th ult. I consulted freely with your brothers and such others as I thought might throw light on the subject. I found very few- not more than one or two who were offering monthly wages, all on the Cooper River as far as I could learn were offering a share in the crop, whether from a want of ability to pay wages &c or because they believed an interest [End Page 1] in the crop would secure a more steady course of labor and prevent stealage, I know not, perhaps both. Your brother was so decidedly in favor of a share in the crop, if for no other reason than because all others were offering it in your neighborhood. I determined to draw up two contracts, one, on the basis of 1/3 of the crop, the other for wages monthly. I did so and took both down to your brothers office to submit them to him, but regretted to find that he was detained at home from sickness. I this week took them to Genl. R K Scott successor to Genl. Saxton and left them with him for perusal and concurrence. They were drawn on the basis of the Darlington Contracts said to have been approved by Genl. Saxton. Genl. Scott demurred to several of the stipulations, and said he would prepare a contract that would not vary much from the ones submitted, and would send me a copy- I have not yet heard from him, when it is recd. I will send you a copy. I urged upon him prompt action as time was passing and he admitted the necessity of action and seemed desirous of doing his duty both to Employer and employees in the spirit of justice to both as far as he was competent. & here lies the difficulty. The fairest minded of all these officials seems not to be able comprehend the difference between the \"nigger\" freedman and the white northern laborer. You can inform the men on the place if they apply to you again that we are waiting on the Bureau for their contract. Yours truly W. McBurney [End Page 2]"
