      "value": "Columbia March 16th 1866 Dear William I have signed the Agreement and will send your copy and Mr. Chadwick's by Express today to Colun Hanckel & Co The arrangement will answer for one year. Its continuance for two and three can be postponed for further consideration. The terms are all too hard, it seems to me at present, to be continued for several years and especially upon me as I may be said to be extended from even the contrival profits of suspension. I fear that these will be all the profits to accrue, as from our share of the crop the two thirds value of the remaining lumber agricultural implements, mules, mule feed, flats, seed rice and all other stock of whatsoever kind will have to be paid. The advance Mr. Chadwick makes to purchase these articles is to be taken back in full then again two thirds of the amount from our shares. Our shares must [End Page 1] this cause be very much reduced. Let us hope to do something better next year. We can't do worse. I would be willing to sell Fife for $100,000. certainly not less than $85000. one half cash- the remainder in one two and three years. I would rather sell than go into these extortionate bargains for cultivating it and the money would enable us to avoid the same kind of arrangements for our other property. Yours truly Jas. B. Heyward [End Page 2]"
