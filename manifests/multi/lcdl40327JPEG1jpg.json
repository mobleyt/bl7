      "value": "My dear Mamma I have just finished writing a long letter to Papa in answer to one received from him. It was like yours exactly of which you write to Mary. I have never written before but thought that I must answer his to me. I told him how we all were and wished him to calmly await Gods will in his restoration to health and to his family, the one would follow the other that it was hard to be sick and away from wife and children but that in his sickness strangers were the best nurses that we missed him -- as much as he us &c. Nan's having a pleasant time here, she is rather fond of going out and [beaux?] have filled her head but I think the Lent season here will diminish the gayety and I am going to [draw?] her in somewhat. She is very good about it all though & always consults Mary about all she is going to do. Stephen is steady and very agreeable so good behaved and even tempered. Singleton is growing rapidly in every way and astonishes every one with his smartness. The [Dentist?] to whom he went with Nan was perfectly charmed with him and as he went to have his daguerreotype taken for Nan yesterday he amused the man so asking him \"is it done?\" and saying \"maybe now\" \"Time to[End Page 1] go home\", \"sing her [illegible] so [pretty?]\". \"Goodbye man. come gain\". He says anything we tell him and Rob is improving vastly -- the merriest [jolliest?] best tempered thing in the world. Mary insists no one care for him but herself. But I feel grateful to her for his goodness and really am quite proud of him though Singleton takes up all my play and baby time. I have been most busy with my garden my new lot. I have gone to work most thoroughly and spaded up 2 feet deep, putting manure and [top?] soil below and [illegible] some well manicured above a beet bed, carrot bed, parsnip bed 2 salsify beds each 15 feet square, [illegible] potato bed [illegible] 30 feet square -- lettuce and spinage 12 feet square and have worked up and spaded one spade deep [illegible] manure, 2 bed of snap beans 20 feet square, 3 of corn 15 and 20 feet square, and am now making an [illegible] celery bed 20 by 10 feet. I have my strawberry bed in order and ground artichokes also fruit trees in bloom, have 4 beds of peas running, also a patch of \"swiss chard\" or \"white beet\" -- and am now preparing for squash, melons, okra [,] tomatoes and cucumber. [Illegible] is cooking this week so that I can have Peter for work. I am doing all thoroughly as it pays best. Besides my 1 1/4 acre garden, I have 1/2 acre lot in rye and getting ready for field corn, guinea[End Page 2] corn and sugar cane. Then my flower garden. The fountain is beautifully green in rye with the shells on top. My literary work goes on too, lectures and Sermons. Then I have my work of prayer meetings and choir meetings. On Sunday afternoon I go to the Hamptons Church and preach to the [So bellians?] & every Wednesday I ride 20 miles on horseback to visit there. But I am happier so, ever employed though I think Mary deems it sometime too encroaching upon her time. As to the State of the Country I have always anticipated War and fear still we will have it but I find I have sensibly lost my interest since Carolinas backwardness in attacking Fort Sumter and the loss of our chances of redeeming our pledge of independence. Willie seems pleased, I hear nothing of the opinion of his officers of him yet. Mary is going with Nan and the babies to Mrs. Singeltons tonight to stay and I may go out after Choir meeting. Do give much love to all and for us. Your affec Son R W Barnwell[End Page 3]"
