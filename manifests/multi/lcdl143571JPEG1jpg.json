Carolina\n\nMay 26th 1747 /\n\nI Susannah Nouvin having been Informed of your Friendly Dispositions to relieve the distressed and needy, have presumed to make the following address to you, hoping my Circumstances may Plead for Compassion at your hands.\n\nSome years ago I left Scotland with my Family in hopes of Receiving some advantages from the Estates of my Brother Thomas Nouvin of this province, but the management of his Estates after his decease falling into the hands of William Buff Esq. It seems he counted little for me unless by some Title from St[uart] William Nouvin my Broth [MS. torn] in Scotland, unto whom Thomas made some application and tho' I have Received several Letters from home Signifying that he would make a Title unto me; Yet the Thing is never yet done, and I am afraid is more Obstructed now than ever by the late unhappy Confusion in Scotland.\n\nI am now Gentlemen left very much Destitute of the necessarys [necessaries] of Life and thrown in a Great measure upon the Kindness of Christian acquaintances and my present Situation is such as Obliges me to Give you the Trouble of this, which [illegible] unto from the Consideration of your known Generosity to your distressed Country People. Hoping that you may take my Condition into your Consideration and Sympathies with me in my distress in this manner you shall judge most proper. I hope you shall find that such Generous actions will Carry around with them and what I cannot do to Recompense You the Almighty God will in prospering You; which is in the hearty prayer of your petitioners\n\n\nSus Nouvin [signature of applicant]"
