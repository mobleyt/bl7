      "value": "Monday Night Camp Marion My Dear Wife I reached here late last night cold and tired, but have been up and Drilling to day. The Road was bad and the Horse tired out so I had to walk a good deal of the way The Storm of Thursday night done a great deal of good, it Wrecked one Steamer for Lincoln on the Georgetown bar the Crew, 19 in number are in Georgetown Jail two of them are Negroes, the Boat was loaded with Provisions for the Lincoln Army Most of it is spoilt [spoiled] and Lost, out of 39 live Beef Cattle our folks have save 5 the rest were drowned. The Boat had a large lot of Bread Pork and Irish Potatoes, they have got 25 Barrels of Potatoes and expect to get the Pork Another Steamer was disabled by the Storm and Captured by Col Manigault in the Nina, she professes to be Spanish but the Col thinks she is Yankee and has anchored her under the Guns of the Fort and auits [awaits] Orders from Ripley. The Captain of the Yankee Steamer that was wrecked says there are 50,000 Troops in the Fleet and that they were destined either for Charleston, Beaufort or Brunswick GA he says we are bound to have our hands full, and says the Yankees say if we beat them this time they are going to quit, so you see that again Providence has caused the Elements to blast the well arranged Plans\n[End Page 1]\nof our bitter foes, and who knows yet how far the disaster of the Storm has reached and whether or not it has not finished this unhappy struggle Oh how thankful ought we to be if elements of wind and rain have interposed to save our Homes from the element of fire and the innocent inhabitants from the Swords. We are now in constant expectation of fighting some portion of the invaders if they should have changed their plans since the Storm and attempt to Land on this Coast which is probable unless the Storm was extensive  Very Violent both East and South of us. there cant now be the shadow of a doubt but what they were fully prepared to land  march through the Country as this wrecked Boat among other things had large quantities of Waggons or rather parts of Waggons on Board. The other parts no doubt being on other Boats, these Waggons were either to transport Baggue [Baggage?] for the Army or to haul Cotton and Rice to convenient Landings on the River to Ship it so you see they are Coming not only to Conquer but also to take possession, who knows but what each Vessel has negroes on Board to act as guides and to incite the Slaves to armed Rebellion this is the Standing threat of the Yankees. I would write more to you about the Fleet and the Blockade etc. if I Knew what to write, but I have given you all\n[End Page 2]\nthe news that has reached me so far and my own crude thoughts on it and as it is late and I am cold I will stop, do write me by every chance you get and let me know how you and the children are and how you get On. If we move to South Island it will be a bad chance for me to hear from you as there is no mail to the Boro, and traveling will to the Island will most likely be stopped, however I will make some shift to hear from you. and now my Wife keep your spirits up don't alarm yourself needlessly about me for I still believe that Yankee Powder will never send Yankee lead through my clothes, for I trust in a Power higher than any earthly one Goodby kiss the children for me God bless you Yours till Death John R Beaty\n[End Page 3]"
