      "value": "A. M. D. G. Ursuline Convent & Academy Columbia S.C. Sept 15th 1863 Sister Mary Charles Curtin Dear Sister in Christ, The pleasant impression produced upon me by you during my sojourn at the \"Sisters\" would induce me to answer you at once favorably. But our good Bishop has spoken now according to our holy rule, which is very stringent on the point of receiving into our noviciate, one who has been professed in another community -- indeed, to have been even a novice is an objection, so that a secular fresh from the world is preferred to either -- which I presume you can readily understand, as it is more difficult to eradicate preconceived ideas of right than to implant true ones for the first time. However, since our constitutions do not, like those of the Carmelites preclude all entrance to such, we are advised to ascertain [End Page 1] the motive of such a desired change, since the saints say on this point, that a Religious should not change from a good to a better state, as from an active to a contemplative order, without great caution. Such desire of change, ordinarily proceeding rather from restlessness of human nature or some other imperfect motive, than from a movement of the Holy Spirit. But since Almighty God sometimes leads souls in this way, we must ascertain whether He has done so in the case proposed, which will be manifest, if she has been an exemplary member of her former community -- & can procure an attestation of this fact from her acting Superioress. If she (the Mother Superior) will attest to the habitual humility, simplicity & (illegible) obedience of the subject proposed -- we may give the matter consideration. Such my dear Sister, are our instructions & the spirit of our holy rule, which I lay before you for your consideration. At the same time [End Page 2] I fell it is my duty to say that you have no conception of the difficulties you purpose to encounter in making such a change -- & our noviciate is a very hard one. I can speak from experience there is no similarity to the ease & freedom which you are accustomed to. We must yield a most unbounded submission, & are check-mated on all sides-- our self-love has no mercy shown to it & we must study to relish & enjoy spiritually being neglected, dispersed & forgotten. We will write our prayers on this subject of such vital importance, & I will await the \"attestation\" as may see proper to send it. With sentiments of sincere regard for yourself & community I remain dear Sister very sincerely yours in (illegible) Sister Baptiste Sup. [End Page 3]"
