      "value": "Athens Nov 23d 1843. My Dear Sir I recd [sometime since?] your letter & prospectus, but was unable to answer it then as events were pending which must decided before I could [give?] my [illegible: hole in page. answer?] to your kind request Within a few [days?] these matters have been settled, & I embrace the earliest opportunity to write a reply. At the earnest solicitation of President Church, & the Faculty of our university here, I have been persuaded to accept the Professorship of Belles Lettres [illegible: faded ink] & Moral Philos to which office I was unanimously elected by the Trustees at Milledgeville last week. [illegible: hole in page] of this post, added to my [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: hole in page] duties forbid me to do, what I otherwise should have done with regard to your Paper. It would have given me pleasure to assist you by my pen, but that is now impossible, except perhaps in the way of religious & ecclesiastical needs in this part of our Diocese. [illegible: hole in page. You?] will please however set down my name as a subscriber & when ever I can give you help, it shall be most cheerfully done. With your views I sympathise most heartily, My motto is [End Page 1] [illegible: page torn] Church as [illegible: page torn] [illegible] [illegible: page torn] Prayer Book & [illegible: hole in page] the [skirts?] of our Church.[illegible: page torn] everything that taints her in the [illegible: page torn] with Romanism & a [illegible] faith [illegible] the Holy Ghost May direct you in [illegible: page torn] Matter! & did you in all your [illegible] endeavour [illegible: hole in page] fervent prayer. My new & beautiful church, though not quite finished, was consecrated by Bp Elliot last Sunday [illegible: hole in page] presence of our overflowing congregation Revd [illegible] Hunt. Ford [illegible: faded ink] were present [illegible] prayer was [illegible] Myself., the [illegible] of Consecration [by?] [illegible: faded ink] [illegible: faded ink], & the Bp delivered a noble discourse from the 84th Ps 1st verse. In the afternoon we had the rite of Confirmation & Communion-- when the Bp laid hands upon 8-- all adults & all persons [illegible: faded ink] character & influence [illegible: hole in page] have presented a larger number [illegible: hole in page] I determined from the [first?] to give in the name of no person of whom [illegible: hole in page] had not satisfactory evidence of a change of heart My number was small. My Church now consists of 17 Communicants & our prospects are truly encouraging. It is the Lords doings, not Mans; & to Him I ever look for guidance & grace-- If He will but build our spiritual house it will rise & shine indeed, & it is my constant prayer that every member of my Church may be a lively stone built upon Jesus [End Page 2] [illegible: page torn] [it?] the living [illegible: page torn] the night of [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] [We?] are now trying to get an [illegible: torn page] which we can do for 7 or 800 [dollars?] Bp has [subscribed?] 150. [Should?] any [illegible: of?] good friends in Charleston [be?] disposed to give 50 or a 100 dollars it would be most gratefully recd. We have a select choir & two [good?] organists. Do not be offended at My liberty in suggesting this, & Do not act upon it if you think it be open & yet I must confess that these [illegible] donations [from?] one church to another & from one diocese to another are [illegible] ties to bind us together, beginning [illegible] on earth, that \"communion of the [Spirit?]\" which will be perfected in Heaven. I thank you My Dear Brother for your Kind advice. I need it. I am a young soldier & you Know that he who is [engaged?] in his first onset, is far more likely to be puffed up, than the veteran [illegible: hole in page] battle fields. God grant that I may [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: faded ink] [illegible: hole in page] Know that without it I shall utterly fail. The Bishop tells me that Dr Boone will [be?] [in?] [the?] diocese this winter [illegible] to see this dear old friend & hope that he will come to Athens where he will receive a most cordial welcome. I should be [gratified?] to hear [from?] you often for you Know that many things conspire to make me love you-- with Kind regards to Miss [Barnwell?] I remain. Yours in the bonds of love.
