      "value": "Saturday September 30th 1837. Dear Stanner, The time now rapidly approaches when we shall bid adieu to Greenville and all its pleasures, and return Home to welcome friends--I would begin to count the weeks that must lapse, ere this happy period arrives--About the 25th of October, we propose starting homewards--We find a great difference in the climate of this place, and Flat Rock--it so much warmer here; it is said that there is a difference of ten degrees--and I am sure it must be so--Mr. Memminger leaves me on Monday for Flat Rock--he is to attend the rail road convention to be held there on the 16th inst.--besides this, his presence is required there to carry on his various operations--such as building or contracting to do so [illegible] land &c, he will come over every Saturday and remain until Monday--What say you to paying us a visit [illegible] M's time were not so much occupied he would go down to Aiken to meet you--but if you could meet with an opportunity up, I should be delighted to[End Page 1] have you come & spend the balance of the season here--Mr. M could and would take you down, in returning, as far as liked--but if Papa would consent to be your escort, it would be exactly the thing--go try and persuade him--if he will not, suppose Sarah accompanies you; the trip might be of service to her--the carriage is now gone to bring a company of children to spend the day with me; three of Mrs. [Stone's/Stowe's] and 2 of Mrs. Williams's--a lady with whom I became very sociable at Flat Rock--Yesterday I paid some visits in the village--Mrs. Hart was one--whilst sitting with her, Mr. Ben [Allotore?] came in to see me--Mrs. Croffst and Mrs Crawford paid me a visit before I went [illegible]--I suppose to make my leter acceptable, it must contain accounts of Miss Alice--with regard to your arrangements for our accommodations, I asked her--which she would prefer to sleep in my room or with you--she said very decidedly \"with Aunt [Anna?]\"--adding, she will sing \"there is a yand--\"land\"--[illegible]--I had previously told her that when she was a little girl you liked to sing that hymn for her to go to sleep. I have no idea how much this pleased & since then she constantly asks for it--this morning to my surprise, she repeated two verses[End Page 2] (the only ones I knew and had sung) to her baby Kathleen--you would be amused to see her of her own accord, run into the piano, look up and address the stars--thus: \"Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are, up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky\" Perhaps you have seen this little piece--very pretty it is--just now she was calling to me \"Lady Byron do [illegible] & shut the window\"--She has some odd fancies--I told you about her calling her Papa Lord Byron, & now she calls me Lady Byron-- Afternoon 6 o'clock--I have [spent?] quite a juvenile day among the children under shady trees--they playing the graces & I [seated?] with my work encouraging them--then they took a game of hide & seek--into the spirit of which [illegible] & myself entered very fully--little [Eli?] is of course as [illegible] as any--and now they have taken a walk down to the spring--I have prepared some refreshments for them--to surprise them on their return--I have placed a table under a tree & put on it cake, fruit & sugar things, candy, [kipe?] with a pitcher of cool spring water--this is not much to be sure, but it is all I can get--I must conclude my letter with the hope of soon hearing from you I am your affectionate sister Mary Mr. M's love--My best love to mama, papa, and the rest--M [End Page 3] Miss Anna B. Wilkinson Care of Dr. W. Wilkinson Charleston So. Ca. [End Page 4]"
