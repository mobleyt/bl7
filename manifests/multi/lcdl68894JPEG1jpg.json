      "value": "R 4 6 44\nMarch 24, '44\nDear Sidney,\nThis is one of those mornings that drives one\nabsolutely crazy to be cooped up inside. Its clear and bright\nand brisk with such a tang of spring in the air it drives you\ncrazy. There's a peach tree breking into bloom that I pass on\nmy way to the office[,]and I would give allthe world to be in the\ncountry.\nThat wonderful Inn I described is now full up in-\ndefinately[,]and I think I made a huge mistake not to engagea room\nby the season so I could go down week ends and play golf. Every-\nthink - everywhere is booked and particularly over Easter. As\nall the south is closed off to travel I presume it makes even\nmore people trying ot get in elsewhere. I guess I must resign\nmyself to the city till the war is over. Lord I hate it too\nnow that the light is long and the evening delicious. I do so\nenvy you your scenery, your air, your sea and your flowers.\nI shall no doubt stew and grown with that burning desire to\nbe out of doors from now on till the end of summer. Cest la\nvie! Cest la guerre! The fun of setting up the office, starting\na new desk etc. etc has all worn off. The whole thing is such\nroutine it lacks stimulous. Its nearly the end of the seventh\nmonth now that I have been here and I want new worlds to\nconquer. I have n't a prayer of a change for ages and I hope\nit is doing my soul good to be so rigidly disciplines and\ngrouved. I am afraid however it does it no good at all- rather\ndulls and flattens me out, puts lines in the face, fat on the\nbones,and a jaded look in the eye. All my bones crack when I \nmove, and my spine creeks at eve[r]y vertabraie[sp?].\nI had chinese foodat a chinese restaurant yesterday[,]\nand then went to see a collection of paintings nearby. Every\npainting was sold although the exhibition had only been on two\ndays. Christie's is selling the Morgan collection here and the\nprices that it is fetching are fantastic. Antiques and jewelry\nand silver[,]have never been higher. Its quite amazing. By afternoon\nso fast inside as rice and chopsuey. It has no staying powerat\nall[,]and one finds one self very hungry by three o'clock.\nOlive has sent me some New Orleans soup- crawfish bisque- which \nI am thrilled with.You remember how er fooled Marshal Field on it.?\nI also have some canned breasts of turkey Rose sent me,so to-night\nafter the theatre I am going ot feast Alfred [illegible] and his beautiful\nbride on a very sumptuous dinner.My parcels from home are a god\nsend, just makes all the difference.\nI had a very amusing time the other day. Marian Hall\na wonderful girl [Red Cross Executive here] lunched with me. She\n[End Page 1]\n2\nShe had received a case of whiskey some time a go from Lehman Bro.\nN.Y. via their Overseas contact. Marian cut the tag off the case\nand suggested we trot around to this source of supply and see what\nwe could do. We gave the address to the taxi driver and he started\nof. We went miles, and I mean miles, to hell and gone into the\nsuburbs and finally landed up up 25 minutes later in front of a ware[-]\nhouse. We went in and asked for the Manager. Hewwas found in a dingy\ncold office wrapped in an over coat and muffler, peering over his\nledgers. He was fat and wore glasses on the end of his nose. Marian\nwent right to the point. Said we were two thirsty Amwricans looking\nfor gin and whiskey. He listened for a bit and then said he had never\nheard of either of us and did n't know who we were, and did not see\nwhy we had not gone to the city office instead of the ware house.\nFrom here on we did our stuf. We said we always went to the source\nof supply, that their American Agents were our pals, we did some\nhand across the sea, anglo-American relations talk etc etc. and e[nded]\nup with each of us with a goblet of straight gin in our hands[,]and\ndrinking toasts to each other. I never ha[d] more of a laugh. Itowe\nwas two o'clock in the afternoon, we had eaten a big lunch, and here\nwe were tossing [gin] down ur throats like straight vodka- in order\nto make our purchase. It ended up by a phone call to the home office[,]\nand each of us going home with a case of gin a piece in the taxi.\n[no whiskey however as that is even rarer and more difficult]. It\nwas a successful trip and we did have a laugh. On the strength of\nthis acquisition I gave a cocktail party last Saturday and had\nabout 18 people. To my amazement only 2 [a half] bottles were consumed\nand everyone seemed to have plenty. It was great fun. Most of my\noffice pals were the guests[,]with some Red Cross gals mixed in.\nI had Dorothy and Anthony Head for dinner the other day. Do you\nremember the day we motored her to the Shonnards and you made up with\nthe Ashly and Cooper River. They are awfully nice. He is one of the\nyoungest Brigadier Generals in the Br. army I believe, and charming\ntoo.\nI miss Ben very much. The old Cornel and I used to lunch often\ntogether at Bucks and talk over old times. I doubt if he gets back\nagain now.\nI shall be very old next week[,]and I think I shall county my\ngrey hairs that day for I am sure I have at least 42 of them.\nI had a letter from Janie dated August '43. She said s[c]heeing\nhad been such fun in the hills with freinds, that their apartment\nwas so beautiful, that as it was hot they were soon going ot the sea\nas they had just bought a house on a beach, etc etc, The old \nusual happy picture of a tr[a]nquil life- one month before invasion.\nSo typical! I wonder if she still feels so peaceful?\nThe war stretches on and on ispite of all this super bombing,\nbut I suppose it must end some day. It cant go on for ever. When\nthat's the question?\nI do get Life and Time now even though very late, but I\nlove them as they really give you a picture than in no other way\none gets.Have you read a book called\"So Little Time!?You must get\nit.Its tops, by the same man who wrote Pulham Esq.\nRaymond has two big Tanny Spanials in the country,and he is\ngoing to find me a fat cream and white spanial soon.\nPlease give my love to all your Brothers.I know you are\nhaving agreat time together-\nLove-\nGertrude Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
