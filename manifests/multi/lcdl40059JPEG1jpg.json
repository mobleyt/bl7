      "value": "Montpelier Oct. 6 1846 My Dear Brother, Your very kind letter from Columbia informing me of the irreparable loss which we & our children had sustained [MS damaged] of our dear Sister Nancy, reached me upon my return [Ms damaged] a visitation in the upper parts of my Diocese & was the the very first intimation I had received that our Sister was considered even dangerously sick. I had supposed that she was affected, as she had been upon another occasion with dyspeptic symptoms & that a journey & a few weeks residence at the Springs could certainly restore her. [Illegible] when I opened your letter I found she was dead--dead too, comparatively among strangers & so suddenly. How wonderful are the dispensations of the Almighty! That there shall have been so many who would have loved to have watched over her dying bed & given her all the consolation man could render & yet that not one of those should have been near to close her eyes--was it not to teach her, that Jesus was quite enough for even the most trying moments?[End Page 1] It is pleasant to remember after so sudden a call to Eternity in that a state of preparedness our Sister always lived. I have scarcely ever met any one who communed more constantly & more closely with God, who lived the life which is [illegible] Christ in God. Her infirmity drew her more closely within herself & forced her spirit, if I may say so, to dwell upon the invisible. Death was no surprise to her in any sense of a want of preparedness, however much it suddenly may have surprised her. I feel that her whole life was a life devoted to God & that her faith was one which was built upon promises [illegible], which she had realized & made her own. She has left an example for all of simpleness of mind & purpose, of [hole in MS] truth [illegible] walking with God, which we may well imitate, preachers tho' we be of the righteousness of Christ. Her [illegible] will be sweet to us all & her prayers will remain for an [illegible] for generations of unborn. In the midst of our sorrow, we have cause for rejoicing that one of her nieces has, I trust, taken her place upon saints in the Church of Christ. Our dear Bets was Confirmed and commenced the last Sunday. The Holy spirit has been manifested very gloriously in our School for the last six weeks & many of our young people have, I trust, made their peace with God. The revival commenced in August the day of the ordination of Mr. Shanklin. Previous to that day two or three of the young ladies had become deeply interested & I had been called upon to pray with them & for them--before that day, however, the[End Page 2] feeling manifested itself more generally under a sermon which Shanklin preached in the afternoon & He remained with us until Wednesday after his ordination, preached Monday morning & Tuesday Evening at our Evening Prayer. From that time until this the feeling has been deepening & extending so that there are very few who have not more or less been impressed--no school Exercise was given for a moment [illegible]--no Excitement of a fanatical kind has been exhibited but there has been a deeper closer study of the Bible, more earnest prayer, tears of repentance & I truly believe a [illegible] of a true & Living faith. After six weeks of most interesting exercise, I confirmed eight on Sunday morning last & admitted the same member to communion. Among them were my dear child, Miss Sally Elmore & Mrs. Maria Jenkins of Charleston, & one of Ralph's daughters. There are [MS damaged] more prepared for communion but as they (illegible) were not Episcopalians & they had not received permission from home to commune, I persuaded them to keep it up for a month. Will you be kind enough to write Bets & help her forward in her Christian course. It is possible I may spend a day with you in Charleston the week after next. I go to carry [Charlotte?] to Beaufort & shall proceed on to Charleston in the Boat of Monday 19 Oct (DV). We are all quite well & unite in love & sympathy with you. Very affectionately Your brother Rev. W.H. Barnwell Stephen Elliott[End Page 3] Bp Elliott Oct 6 1846 <MACON GA OCT 9> Rev. William H. Barnwell Charleston South Carolina [End Page 4]"
