      "value": "Beaufort. April 27th 1833. My dear Day. I thank you very much for your last letter. It seemed most especially adapted to my feelings and situation at the time of its arrival-- I received it [two?] nights before my Ordination-- and was much strengthened and comforted. To evidence my gratitude, I have as you see anticipated the day agreed upon-- I expect to leave this for Pendleton tomorrow, and as the 1st of May would be spent upon our journey, my heart constrained [me?] to write to you now-- I am in a great hurry only snatching a little time before the Family assembles for Prayers-- in what you [would?] Bachelor that you are, call great confession, as both of my sons, are unwell, and fretting in the Nursery-- I [illegible] [illegible] scarcely be held responsible for the sense, or sobriety of what I write, It only [comes?] from the heart, and as that is often, too often foolish and light and trifling-- it is not to be respected that that is unreservedly poured from it, should not [partake?] largely of its Nature-- Only for sincerity can I reach-- If you will read the rest of this letter on these terms-- go on-- If not burn it. and write me a scold for writing so lightly and irreverently, after I have become a Reverend-- Yes I have been ordained, and though I hope I am not blind to the responsibilities of the Office, or unaware of the constant, and bitter warfare I am about to enter into, against the World, the Flesh & the Devil-- yet it pleased our Gracious Father [to?] [give?] [me?] on that day an unwonted pleasure of his Heavenly Grace-- and I think I can say it was one of the happiest days of my life-- It was in the Church of my Fathers, the Place [illegible: where?] for [illegible], their voices, and of many of them, their hearts, had been lifted up to God in Prayer-- Their Tombs and Ashes were around me-- My friends and family all present, most of them sincere believers in Jesus, all invoking a blessing-- upon whom? Upon [me?] who had sinned away the best days of his life-- who had revisited Gods Grace for years, had blasphemed his name-- reached his People-- but who notwithstanding [End Page 1] all, there stood that day-- a miracle of Grace-- about to be set apart for the Ministry of Christ-- Oh how did the sins of my past life rise in revile before me! my follies how they seemed to mock me-- but how was my heart melted with Love, when I looked to the Blessed Jesus, and Saw all-- all-- washed out and cleansed in the [illegible] of his precious blood! Oh thou bleeding Lord! how can I ever cease to preach the preciousness of that blood, which has washed white, so vile a sinner as me-- Thou Holy Spirit of Grace-- how can I but praise and glorify thee, which had renewed and sanctified a creature so [illegible: imperitent?], and unbelieving!-- My God. my God-- let me never forget the horrible pit, and the miry clay-- whence thou hast drawn me-- Let me in all humility-- and with an untiring zeal-- preach thy Glorious Gospel-- thy boundless Love-- [thy?] [illegible] free Grace-- On that day the Heavens and the Earth seemed to me in near and often communion-- I could almost fancy that joy was filling the bosoms of my friends and family departed in the Faith, at the sight of a Prodigal returned to his Fathers House, and about to be installed a Steward of the Household-- Perhaps it was vanity or Pride-- I have enough of both God knows, but there was a strong impression on my mind that Holy and bodiless Spirits were witnessing with Joy that spectacle-- But I wonder,-- pardon me-- You know I promised nothing but an effusion from the heart-- Yes, Day I am not a Preacher of the Blessed Gospel-- When I think of the Triumphs of the Cross-- of the Power of Grace-- I feel strong and bold as a Lion. I am ready like St Paul, to [want?] not my life dear. so that I may finish my course with Joy-- But myself-- myself-- myself-- when I look at this sinful, infirm and fickle self of mine-- I almost despair-- Yet I trust only in the Lord-- He called me-- He led me so far-- why should I doubt his Power and willingness to carry me on through the Wilderness-- He will-- He will-- Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ-- What though I be hated & [reviled?] of [men?]-- what though Satan assail me-- what though my own sinful heart lead me into sin & folly & trouble-- Is not God for me? Who can be against me-- Is not His the Kingdom? Is not his the Power? And oh when my labours [an?] [illegible] I shall meet. him [End Page 2] and see Him as He is, will not I cast my crown at his feet and give Him all the Glory? Lord Jesus! increase my Faith! I am on the coming day to leave my Home-- my kindred-- my Fathers House-- for what? for the Land of Promise-- Surely the God who called Abraham-- & I trust has called me-- will not leave me helpless and comfortless-- Oh as I \"look for [a?] City which hath foundations, whose Maker and Builder is God\". When did ever a [man?] give up anything for God, and not receive ten fold? Though my heart strings are bound around many dear objects here-- Let them be loosed-- nay let them crack ere I refuse to follow the voice of the Lord-- So I feel when Gods Grace is with me-- in my heart-- but at times I am weak, and timid-- Pray for me [dear?] [illegible: Day?]-- Pray that I may be [upheld?] [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] that [I?] may turn thousands, and thousands of souls to Christ, and shine as the stars [forever?] & ever-- but above all Pray that I may submit with the utmost cheerfulness to the Will of God-- so that if tomorrow, He should call me to Him, my heart should respond \"Lord here am I.\" Let me beg you to pray for the Parish to which I am sent-- I would propose that every Sabbath Morning at our Devotions, we especially remember the Congregations to which we [illegible: page torn. respectfully?] belong-- I think much-- what Christian does not, who trust Gods Promises? of two Christians agreing together [touching?] one thing to be asked of their Lord-- I promised nothing serious in this Letter. yet I do approach now a most solemn and [momentous?] subject-- solemn especially to yourself-- Have you ever dear friend & brother in the Lord-- inquired seriously of God & your own heart, whether you [illegible: hole in page. were?] [illegible: hole in page. not?] called to preach the Gospel? God forbid that I should rushly urge any one [illegible: hole in page. to?] take upon himself this office, unless he be fully persuaded that he is called-- But I have thought seriously, especially from your last letter that you were destined for the Ministry-- God is your Director-- Let what I have said-- only induce you to spread the matter before Him, candidly and [submissively?], and I shall feel satisfied with the result, whether it lead your to the Ministry or not. How I should rejoice to think that you my old friend and associate, are fighting with me the Battles [End Page 3] of our Lord-- of course should not have any influence over you-- But dear Day look to God, and ask him this question-- \"Am I not called to Preach the Gospel?\" I [have?] preached (to go back to myself) four or five times-- I like the [work?] [and?] at times enjoy the Presence of God in it, astonishingly-- [illegible: but?] I [am?] [still?] satisfied with myself-- I cannot forget man-- I cannot look entirely to God-- I have been advised to write my Sermons instead of Preaching Extempore. & though I find no difficulty-- rather a pleasure in [writing?] them-- yet. when I come to preach in the Pulpit. and not what is [as?] on the heart in the Closet-- In fact I am obliged at times-- to leave [illegible] [Book?] & break out-- but this makes me more violent at such times than if [I?] [preached?] the whole extempore-- I am however in Gods hands. I [illegible] to [illegible] for direction-- I desire to speak the Truth in Love-- [illegible] [illegible] [illegible: is?] [illegible]-- [illegible] [illegible] It is possible. I may preach in Savannah-- tomorrow night-- If. Shaffer should be present. and hear me-- who can tell but the Lord may touch his heart-- When I think of our unconverted friends, I feel as if I could fall on my knees, & beg them to come to Jesus & be happy-- The hour for our Family Prayers has arrived-- I will try & remember you there, May God bless you, and your friends, and [relatives?], may you all while passing through this world, receive Grace to rejoice, in the God of your Salvation-- Oh Pray for me-- pray-- for me-- remember when you pray for a Minister, you are praying for his Flock-- Yours truly dear Day in Christ Jesus. W.H. Barnwell [End Page 4]"
