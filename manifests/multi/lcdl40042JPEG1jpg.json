      "value": "Private Millwood Jany 26 '44 My Dear Bro, I have been thinking for some time past that without at all interfering with the affairs of another Diocese, I might at least write you a short letter of thanks for your weekly present of the Episcopal Protestant, as even the New York Church now praises you for the honest simplicity of your paper, & as all must acknowledge that it is conducted as a gentleman & Christian should do it--which is far from being the case with all so-called religious papers--may I an old friend, & agreeing with you in every thing--when Calvinism may commend you a little. Let not these precious balms break the head of your integrity my good brother, but God give you grace to pursue, with the true Christian spirit with which you have begun the even tenor of your way. As you have Bishops Hall--Usher--[Beverige?]--Andrews and Hooker to sustain you in your doctrine of election & perhaps the 17th article--and Bishops White--H.W. Onderdonk -- Hopkins and others to sustain you in your Episcopal views, perhaps I ought not to enter a caution about extremes. Still so prone is man to such things, that I will pray, that in any controversies into which you may be drawn, you may be preserved from any enterprises which [End Page 1] injure the usefulness of your paper. You must not understand me as differing from you in the views you have presented of church government. One or two [illegible] I thought rather strong & calculated to injure you. By this time you have doubtless seen Bishop Hopkins pamphlett on the subject & will make good use of it. God is raising up defenders of [illegible] views from the works of the enemy as it were. What with the [illegible] from our own religious press & the political press & the papers of all the denominations, I think tractarianism will be no [secret?] in our country. I cannot but hope that God will ere long let us plainly see how he will overrule it all for good to his blessed truth. I do not mean to take up much of your fully occupied time with reading my letter, nor would I trespass on it by insisting on an answer, but if without neglecting other things you can find a moment to let me hear how you & yours are, & how the works of the lord is prospering in your hands, it will gratify your sincere friend & brother William Meade[End Page 2] Bp Meade Jan. 1844 PAID 25 <MILLWOOD FEB 2 Va.> The Revd William Barnwell Charleston South Carolina [End Page 3]"
