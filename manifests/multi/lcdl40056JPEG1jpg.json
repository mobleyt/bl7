      "value": "controversy of the kind at the outset. You will also perceive how very desirable, almost necessary, it is under the circumstances for me to return, if I am to do so, the next Fall. Indeed such are the customs & regulations of the Churches in the city here, that if I do not return next October, it will be expected that I wait until the same time the next year. This would be agreeable to me; but I doubt if it would meet with any but the most reluctant consent on the part of the vestry of the Epiphany. What, then, I am desirous of you getting the vestry of the Church in Charleston to do is, that provided the Bp. writes to me, & will receive me, they should forthwith send me a call--if possible, leaving it optional with me [illegible] in such a way that I can return either next Fall or the Fall following. If possible, I will get the vestry here to defer matters until Oct. 1847-- but if they seem reluctant to do this, then, I will return in Oct 1846; services will have to be commenced in a \"conventicle.\" I hope, enough has been said to explain how matters stand, & when the necessity of the most immediate action [waits?] on the part of Bp. Gadsden, & on the part of the vestry of [Grace?] church. Upon you I depend to bring matters to an issue. By the 30th my answer to the people here must given; & a [End Page 1] J.H. Fowles 16 April 1846 definite understanding had. I need not say how much involved my feelings are in the success of the whole enterprise in Charleston, & notwithstanding my health & life, regard, & have so viewed these things for years, as very precarious, & that they will perhaps be rendered more so by living in Charleston, yet all the circumstances leave neither my judgment, nor my heart, any choice in the matter. I trust, therefore, that all concerned will see it is no whim of mine, but the force of circumstances, which render necessary the stand that I have taken in relation to my return, which is, that unless the way he opened as regards the Bp, & I am enabled to act definitely by the action of the vestry of Grace Church, on the 30th Inst, I will have to give up all thoughts of leaving my present charge. I leave the whole matter in the Lord's hands & under Him with you--praying that it may be [ordered?] in such a way as will be most to His glory & the furtherance of His cause, both here & in Charleston. Your's affectionately in XC. J.H. Fowles. C.G. Memminger, Esq. Charleston So. Ca.[End Page 2]"
