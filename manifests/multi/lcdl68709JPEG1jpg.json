      "value": "THE BRIGHTON HOTEL\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\nCALIFORNIA AT CONNECTICUT :: TELEPHONE NORTH 4430\nSunday, December 10, 1944.\nDear Gertie:\nWe were at Dean Hall a week ago, the only time I have\nbeen there except for five days when I got back in the spring. We\nhad two days of that beautiful crips early winter weather, cold\nexcept in the sun, when every leaf glistens, the brown grass\nis crimson and the smoke from the cabins hung blue against\nthe pine woods. It made us heartsick not to be able to jump\nin a car, run over the Medway from lunch with our neighbours.\nSpend the afternoon walking for quail and then return to a\nbig roaring fire in the gun room and some of Sidney's Old\nFashioneds. Oh, well, some day, some day, perhaps sooner than\nwe can possibly imagine now. God, how lovely and peaceful\nthe country seemed. Sidney had felt it too, the few days\nhe was there, for he seemed to find it surprisingly pleasant\nafter Paradise Island, once he had faced the silence and\nemptyness of the place, and we talked of returning to our\nhammocks and our baids [?], letting the days drift, and not\nworrying if the roof leaked, the shooting was poor, or the\nhawgs got cholera. I did not go to Charleston, but Carola\nwent down to inspect the houses and found them all standing.\nSaw nobody but my parents, who seemed well, older than\nthree years ago, which is natural. We talked so much\nabout you. Dean Hall is exactly the same, the house, fires,\nfood, Tillman and Linda Lee. They are isolated, see scarcely\nanyone, seldom leave the place. Vardell has only three able bodies\nmen, but has accomplished wonders with them, a tractor and a\nforce of women, holding the wilderness at bay. No country goes\nas fast with the wind. Sidney's description of driving up to\nMedway was wonderful, in his first vein, true on the whole \nthink he found it in good shape. Saw him and Morris\n[End Page 1]\na great deal, for they were in and out of the Department all\nthe time and we had lunch and dinner together several times.\nBoth of them looked fine. Of course, I got a great about \nwonderful climate, sunshine, vegetation, swimming, all the\nset up, but not as much as I had expected, and I personally\nwonder if it won't all seem a bit stale after another\nsession. They seemed to like a bit of bracing fall weather,\nif you can ever call this town \"bracing.\" We moved into this\nhotel a month ago, from a quaint little house in Georgetwon\nwhere we spent the summer. It had a delightful garden with\nsome big trees, but when fall came you began to notice\ndraughts and discover that the furnace and hot water systems\nwere pretty \"quaint\" too. So the clanking steam heat of this\nhotel feels very good. We have an \"apartment\" in which we\nare [illegible] with our daughter and nurse. The latter cultivates\nher voice, undaunted by the fact its volume cries for\nCarnegie Hall instead of the cozy dimensions she shares with\nus. But we love it - it tells us she is happy and not going\nto walk out to a job in the Treasury and leave us to\n\"mind\" Carla. The hotel is a residential hotel, full of\ngold braid and stars and arthritic widows. As for war,\nnobody give a damn about anything that's happened since\nDewey sailed the seas. I love the soothing atmosphere. My\ndays are busy enough to pass quickly. We go out quite a\nlot, most of it dull as possible, occasional fun, not\nmuch. My life is a week to week affair, always with the\npossibility of being sent away again, so I sleep with my\nfingers crossed. There is very little news from here to amuse\nyou. Louise's Kay is back and for good. Heard this from\nHuger's wife, Fifi, the other night at Barry's, along with\nother N.Y. Talk. Audrey plays bridge all day long, when \nnot rainy. Boone is supposedly sold and all the furniture\nand [illegible] make of her setting in a very grand new\n[End Page 2]\nTHE BRIGHTON HOTEL\nWASHINGTON, D. C.\nCALIFORNIA AT CONNECTICUT :: TELEPHONE NORTH 4430\nFifth Avenue apartment. Helen and Avery are off to shoot quail with\nGeorge and Jessie today. Bug is here for a good while, which \nis nice, also John and Teddie, Bill and Anne. Gee lives\nhere with a new, dark and dour looking husband and is sorry\nto present him with [illegible] any day now. Nothing that\ninterests me can I write about, so this is a synthetic letter.\nHave to go to N.Y. on business the end of this week for two days.\nSo may hear something or see somebody to amuse you in\n my next. That city is roaring, although since spring I have\n not seen it except to pass through en route to Carmel three\n or four weekends. But the [illegible] of alien atmosphere do not\n appeal. The theatres sound wonderful, but try to fight your \n way in. It all seems another world from our surroundings of\n last winter. We think and talk of you constantly. Several people\n I met have seen Sarah -  none recently, but all sounds\n unbelievably, untouchably well. I think she missed a few\n days of joy last spring, but not enough to hurt her game,\n and the hair and nails have never lacked attention and the\n clothes, until recently, came from where they always had\n come. Shall write again before long, now that we have\n learned how. This takes you our very best love.\n Ben.\n [End Page 3]_"
