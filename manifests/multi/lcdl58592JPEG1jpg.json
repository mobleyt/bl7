The V Housing corporation, which  is in the midst of a program of constructing 2,500 housing units, has  1.000 of these under construction in  the area north of the city. Work is  expected to begin in the city on  construction of 115 units, and within six to eight weeks on about 400  units in Byrnes Down, a new subdivision to be opened in St. Andrew\"s parish.
