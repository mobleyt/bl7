      "value": "Beaufort Sept 9th 1834 I was much gratified yesterday dear James to hear from Mama that she had received a letter from you and that you were quite well and had returned to Cambridge after a pleasant tour to Canada: I hope you found the travelling and accommodations better than we did seven years ago I don't know that that country is in such an improving state as our own is but I think it ought to have improved some and particularly when it was so much needed as it was then; at that time Quebec only had one good Hotel and Montreal though better off not half enough to accommodate the numerous travelers they really made our people rude to get accommodated comfortably when we got out of the S Boat at La [?] I think was the name to go to Montreal the [?] to get [Calar..?] first to proceed and engage Lodgings was too bad and I could not help thinking afterwards it was better to be quiet and not boisterous for we who seem so hurried to have much the most comfortable Lodgings because not so well known as to attract the attention of those who went in just to get there at the most celebrated- I presume you have seen all that was worth seeing for you were young and unencumbered with Ladies therefore had it more in your power to do so. I presume [by] this Nat has left you and also presume you feel more than normally alone I think after long separation from friends being with them is delightful but it leaves us certainly feeling the deprivation of their society much more severely than we did [End Page 1] before it is said \"absence is a cure for love\" in many respects it is I believe true we are wisely formed for getting over feeling the loss of what we cannot get or see if that was not the case we never could be happy in this world for it is time that \"we are home to troubles as the sparks fly upward\" we must be separated by death even if we our ever so happily situated as not to be separated while alive- I often long for the time for your return it is true I write you but seldom but do love you most ardently I have an unconquerable aversion to letter writing which I ought to be ashamed of as if I cannot get rid of my bad habits how am I to expect it from those who are younger their only plan is not to get into them but that is hard to convince poor human nature of we are so prone to do what we like at the time not remembering by the experience of others we will be sorry enough for it in after life-I believe I am right in expecting you home in the winter of 1838 I presume you hope to see Nat and his Lady with Hetty on that occasion I have not heard any hint of the kind but presume that will be their route about that time- if the time is approved for his nuptials I presume you have been made acquainted with it as you are so far off it will not be likely it will be heard- I am sure I wish her much happiness she is certainly a fine Woman and a very fine looking one-I hope you are still pressing on being determined to get through I presume you occasionally have a southern recruit though not so frequently as formerly I am told James Cuthbert is gone on to Cambridge I hope he will remain and graduate and give pleasure to his Parents - I am told their affections are very much set upon him natural enough they have lost most of their sons they now only have an infant one besides him [End Page 2] You know I always leave news to Nat and Hetty I am late a poor gatherer of that but will say that these young people have had enough of parties of pleasure this summer to have made them quite happy if they will make them so at present there is somewhat a cessation to those- M Cuthbert and E Heyward paid a visit to Beaufort a few weeks since and consequently many parties were given and they appear to be rather worn out I don't think any thing like dissipation agrees with Beaufort people they could keep it up long- The Town is remarkably healthy this season- Bay Point is quite a watering place to Beaufort almost could support a Steam Boat this intercourse is so constant there and now these four houses two [?] and your Uncle Tho. and Mr Wm Elliott's I presume you have heard of the intended change of the means of the Smith family as Nat was quite full of it- I suppose you now Possess this you will see Mr R Barnwell Rhett has taken his seat in [page torn] grip I hope they may enjoy it but I don't think any one else does but it is time every body has a right to do with their name as they please-- Your Aunt Caroline and Charlotte continue to improve in health but sweet M Elliott who we are expecting and hoping to see next week I fear will only arrive at home to [d..?] in how distressing letters from both Stephen and himself his case is very desperate- she is alive and that is all I am sure dear James we have deaths of young people enough in our family to remind us to prepare early in life for death which we have a right to expect early - don't let this make you feel sad except the sadness of feeling yourself a sinner and that Jesus is waiting to [?] us as his children by giving us his grave- All well Uncle Smith sends you much love and says you ought to find what he wants to hear from the College [End Page 3] Library - Do write me soon I love to hear from you With much affection believe me yours M Smith [center:] BEAUFORT S.C. SEP 11 Mr James B Heyward Cambridge Massuchusetts [End Page 4]"
