      "value": "Savannah August 6 1840 Rev & Dear Bro, What has become of Mr. Fielding? I have heard nothing further respecting him since he went to Charleston, but that he had proceeded to Alexandria for the purpose of pursuing a course of Theological study in reference to the doctrines of our Church. My attention has been turned toward him very specially of late, in consequence of the following announcement made in one of our newspapers, which, by the bye, is edited by Mr. Hogan, who was some years since excommunicated from the Church of Rome in consequence of some disturbances which he made in Philadelphia where he was stationed as an officiating priest. \"Marriage of the Reverend Mr. Fielding\" recently Roman Catholic Priest of this city Married, on the 23rd also at the First Baptist Church, Philadelphia, by the Rev Mr. Ide, the Rev. Joseph Fielding to Miss Maria Madeira, missionaries to Africa. The ceremony was performed at the close of the interesting & solemn services of the ordination of Mr. Fielding to the monk of the Gospel ministry-- \"Savannah Republican Aug. 4 1840. As it was very evident to me that individual married must be another of the same [MS torn] and not our Mr. John Fielding, I [MS torn] to be published in our newspaper [End Page 1] a notice that the Revd Mr. Fielding, lately married in Philadelphia was not the Revd John Fielding late of this city but a missionary of the Baptist persuasion. That the caption of this notice was a willful misrepresentation on the part of the Editor referred to there is little doubt in the minds of those who know him--and in fact the Editor of the Telegraph charged him with it in the afternoon's paper of the same day. In conversation with a Catholic in reference to this publication, the question was asked whether I had heard any thing of Mr. Fielding lately, as it was said that his mind had become unsettled. But having heard noting of this as would have been the case, no doubt, if the report were true, I avowed an Entire disbelief of it. Now, as Mr. F. was permitted to depart from this place in peace, without being vilified or slandered in any way, I should like to have it in my power promptly to meet the imputation of his not being in his right mind--and therefore beg the favor of you to communicate to me any information which may have reached you respecting him. He had a good report of all men, during the term of his residence here, and was much regretted when he departed--and I feel anxious that he should give full proof of having renounced Romanism [MS torn] principles alone. [End Page 2] The decision of Mr. Elliott to accept the Episcopate of Diocese is welcome news to us all--It is the consummation of a desire which, individually, I have long cherished, & for which I have laboured diligently. That the church will prosper under him I have no doubt, as the whole course of divine Providence has clearly shown that this was designed to be the field of his usefulness. I understand that Mr. Spear has accepted a call to Philadelphia and that St. Paul's has become vacant by the resignation of the two Hanckells. If these things be so, you will be somewhat at a loss I suppose to fill the vacancies. Do let me know what has brought about these changes and oblige me. Very respectfully I remain your fr. & br. Ed Neufville [End Page 3] Rev. E. Neufville August 7th 1840 making inquiries respecting Mr. Fielding Ansd August 8th 1840 &lt;SAVANNAH GEO. AUG 7&gt; Revd Wm H. Barnwell Charleston S.C. [End Page 4]"
