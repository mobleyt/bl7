      "value": "SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES.\n\nMadame R. Acelie Togno,\n\nCHARLESTON, S. C.\n\nThis School is designed to offer to parents a thorough and practical education for their daughters, and a home of refined and domestic comforts, where great attention is given to forming habits of order, industry and regularity.\n\nAll the arrangements of the house are made with a view to the comfort of the Pupils; and no effort is spared to cultivate their manners and to engender a home feeling.\n\nLeave of absence is never granted, except in cases of emergency, and the request MUST BE MADE DIRECTLY TO Madame Togno, AND NEVER THROUGH THE PUPIL.\n\nThe Parents or Guardians of each boarding pupil, are expected to give WRITTEN DIRECTIONS to Madame Togno with respect to visits to be made and received.\n\nNo boarding pupil is permitted TO SPEND A NIGHT AWAY FROM MADAME TOGNO'S HOUSE, nor will any young lady be permitted to go out in the evening, or attend places of public amusement with friends and visitors, unless she holds a written request so to do, signed by a Parent or Guardian.\n\nNo Parlor boarders are received.\n\nPocket money to be given to the pupil by Madame Togno, at her discretion. Experience has fully proved the importance of this rule, and it will be rigidly enforced.\n\nA regular record is kept of the diligence, neatness, deportment and scholarship of each pupil. The discipline of the School is parental, firm and uniform. It is a leading object to enlighten the mind with the instructions of Holy Writ; and to present to each pupil considerations derived from the moral relation she sustains, and the important influence of her present pursuits on her future destiny. Her moral and social position is constantly referred to, and the principles which should govern the one, and the decorum which should distinguish the other, are daily inculcated. \n\nMadame Togno is a member of the Episcopal Church, but makes no attempt to interfere with the religious persuasion of her pupils; they attend regularly their respective churches.\n\nNo Pupil received for less than the Scholastic year, which is divided into TWO SESSIONS OF FOUR MONTHS AND A HALF EACH,  from October 1st, to 15th February, and from February 16th to 30th June.\n\nThe number of Pupils is STRICTLY LIMITED, as Madame Togno desires that the young ladies committed to her care should, by the liberality of their SLEEPING, TOILET and TABLE ARRANGEMENTS, acquire such habits of modesty, neatness and propriety, as distinguish every well educated woman. \n\nEach Boarding Pupil must be furnished with a sufficient wardrobe and twelve towels and twelve napkins. \n\nNo clothing will be furnished after a Pupil enters, without special permission of Parents or Guardians. Funds for the same must be deposited with Madame Togno.\n\nThe course of instruction embraces all the branches that constitute a thorough education. It is required that each Pupil join the French Class, as that language is attended to with a view to practical usefulness, and is exclusively spoken in the School and family.\n\nThe English Department is in the charge of a Professor of acknowledged experience and merit. \n[End Page 1]\nTERMS PER SESSION OF FOUR MONTHS AND A HALF.\n\nBoard, in advance, $115 00\nUse of Bed, Bedding, Lights, [and]c., 12 00\n\nTUITION.\nSenior Classes, 45 00\nJunior Classes, 35 00\nElementary Class, 30 00\nInstrumental Music, 45 00\nVocal Music and Accompaniments, 50 00\nUse of Instruments, 5 00\nItalian, Spanish, German, (each,) 15 00\nDrawing, 18 00\nStationery, 3 00\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nPHILADELPHIA.\nRev.
