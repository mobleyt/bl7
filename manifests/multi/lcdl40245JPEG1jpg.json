      "value": "Orangeburg. January 1st 1849. Happy New Year to you My Dear Mamma & I am enjoying it in Orangeburg. You may wonder what I am doing here! It is however soon explained. I intended to have gone up on Saturday-- but I had seen so little of the village. & they are all such fine people that I was obliged to stay. I met Dr Laborde too who told me that 5 professors are absent from College & Tuesday would be good [illegible] as the duties commence on Wednesday next. This is a charming place I dont Know when I have spent a pleasanter time. The people are the most hospitable I ever met, & delight in entertaining strangers. Col Glovers family is a paradise in it self. He a very fine intelligent & a gentleman throughout. His lady is also a perfect lady & not as you might imagine at all rustic-- but very “citified.”-- And Miss Ella of course a bewitching & charming young lassie.-- More of her anon, [&?] now for the other children, There are 3 boys.-- & 2 little girls.[End Page 1] one Bets age & she sings delightfully -- the other the age of Nancy -- one of the smartest children I ever met & she begs me to remember her to my little sisters she wishes she could see them, she is very sociable & we have struck up quite an acquaintance. The eldest boy 10 years old -- is decidedly the handsomest boy I ever saw -- sings delightfully & plays on the piano -- the other is very small & the 3d a baby. The family is one of the most happy, I have ever seen & the house kept splendidly. Mrs Glover is seen in every thing that requires the House Keepers care. I dont know when I have been more pleased with a village either. No sooner did I arrive than the hand of friendship was immediately extended by young and old & I really felt as if I had visited a home of former days. The family into which cousin [Henry?] marries is a very fine one. I like his two sisters very much & indeed the whole family. If I am any judge I really think she has done well. I leave here tomorrow reluctantly but yet for dutys sake & I will give the girls a description of all the fun I have had here anon. I have snatched this time from my pleasures to write you & with much love to Papa & the children & yourself goodbye Your affectionate Rob[End Page 2] Mrs William H. Barnwell Charleston So. Ca.[End Page 3]"
