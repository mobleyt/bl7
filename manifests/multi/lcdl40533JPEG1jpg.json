      "value": "HdQrs 3rd Sub Dist SC  James Island February 8th 1865    Dear Joseph  I received your note a few days ago and as [illegible] Heyward dined with us that day I got him to attend to the commission.  On communicating with him yesterday, he informed me that Lieut. Mazyck in accordance with a previous request had left you forage in Columbia with Cadet Murdock at the Arsenal, where you can obtain it at your pleasure.  Please ask Hettie to send the cloth I wrote to her about, provided they will assure her that it will reach EMB in Charleston, after which I must run my chances for its safety -- as although I concur in the caution shown by her, under ordinary circumstances -- still I would at present run greater risks for it, as I am wearing pants that cost about $200.00 which wont suit you know.  We are all well here but rather disappointed at the little show of energy and decision.  In haste  Stephen E. Barnwell"
