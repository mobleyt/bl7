      "value": "AW TO AID DRIVE  FOR ROAD BEAUTY  Deegation Passes Bi to Set  Up Committee to Better  Highways\" Appearance  Growing out of a popuar movement to preserve the natura beauty of owcountry highways from  excessive commerciaism and negect, the county deegation to the  general assemby has provided for  creation of a Charleston county  board of highway beautification.  The bi setting up such a board  was sent to Governor Oin D. Johnston. The movement was started by  a committee, under the chairmanship of Aderman J. Albert Von  Dohen and the secretaryship of  Robert N. S. Whitelaw, which responded to an editoria pea by The  News and Courier that the new  North Charleston bouevard be  made attractive, possiby under general assemby statute.  The committee is chlarged with  the duty of making a survey of the  roads in the county before January 1 each year, with the view of  Additional beautification. It is to report to the deegation. It is instructed specificay to inquire into  enforcement of aws prohibiting  cutting of shrubbery used for road  decoration and destruction of shade  trees along the rights of way, and  \"to take proper measures to procure\" their effectiveness.  Two members are to be named by  city Council and two by the egisative deegation for two-year terms.  They, are to be commissioned by the  governor but, pending receipt of  their commissions, are to perform  the duties of the board. The fifth  member will be the chairman of the  sanitary and drainage commission,  ex-officio.  following word that the bi had  passed,  Mr. Von Dohen  said:  \"I took the matter up with Senator Cotesworth P. Means and with  Representative J. wifred D. Zerbst,  secretary of the Charleston county  egisative deegation, asking their  cooperation and setting forth to  them the objective of this new  highway beautification committee  for Charleston county. I also took  the matter up with V. E. Towes,  senior Federal highway engineer for  South Carolina, who appauded the  objective of our committee. He stated that it was the purpose of the  Federal government to beautify the  North Charleston road by planting  ornamenta shrubs and other plant  life and he suggested that it would  be most hepfu if our committee  could have the egisature enact a  aw, reguating the pacing of signs  and  advertisements,  if  such a aw  could be framed that would stand  the test.  \"I also took the matter up with  Chief Highway Commissioner Ben  Sawyer and was assured of the  very heartiest cooperation from the  state highway department. I conferred several times with E. T.  Heyward, highway commssionei-  for this district, who has been most  cooperative.  \"In my opinion, the creation of a  Charleston county board of highway beautification will be most  hepfu in the work of this committee. It should in .point of fact secure the objective for which this  committee was organized. This  Charleston county board should be  able to operate without Imposing  any burden of taxation because of  its creation, if it secures, as has  been promised, the cooperation of  both the Federal and state highway  agencies.\""
