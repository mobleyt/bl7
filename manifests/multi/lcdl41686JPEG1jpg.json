My Dearest Brother, I would like to have written before, & wished you a happy Easter, but owing to our Academic Examinations -- (an abscess in the ear, from which I have been suffering)-- & other pressing duties, I have been unable to do so before-- Our examination closed yesterday, & today we have sent the children to attend the services in the Church-- John having very kindly arranged seats for them. Our Altar is very handsome-- & was all arranged without my having to put a hand to it-- the blessing of having numbers [written on left side of page:] I have a scruple of conscience for putting the stamp on the back of the letter, because you once told me not to do it-- but I have not room on the front this time, so you will not consider it disobedience will you? [written on right side of page:] Madame Lynch[End Page 1] to share the labors-- As it is, I am very tired-- as the children say-- & suppose you are too-- after the \"Mandate & serving in the Refectory' selor [(ca?] [illegible: regle?] Dg) Sr Rose has been confined to her room with a swollen limb for a few days, but is up just now-- all the rest are quite well (TG), We had a visit from Miss Glenn (?), in whom I am agreeably surprised for I had pictured to myself a little hunchback, like Jeremy Maynard (if you recollect him) She is very intelligent & may be of great service-- Just think she was educated in the Ursuline Convent of New Orleans--! The Sisters, did not refuse her, any more than she refused them; indeed she spoke as if it were only her own inability to perform their duties, & disinclination to going out, that carried her to turn her thoughts elsewhere[End Page 2] I received a \"Holy Week\" book from \"Kelly Hedian & Piet\" with compliments &c, asking about the Manual-- I answered that I had written to \"Lucas & Bros\" but had rcd no reply, which I feared arose from my not knowing their proper address, which I could neither find in the \"Mirror\" or Almanac (by the bye-- where is the Almanac I asked you for-- I am ashamed to ask Murphy for one at this late day) and, if they would forward me the right address, it would expedite the business-- that it was, or is our intention to retain the copy rights of our Manual, & ask from them 10cts for every copy sold-- but could make no arrangement before hearing from \"Lucas & Bros--\" How is Anna? I suppose she is with you, please give[End Page 3] her my aff. love & say that I received both hers & Julia's letters & was much pleased to learn that they were well, & enjoying themselves-- perhaps she will have the kindness to, let Julia know this, as I do not know when I can write-- I have not heard either from our dear home, Sr Mary or Sr Antonia lately-- John & family are quite well, DG--. Our Sisters unite in presenting their grateful respects & begging your benediction-- especially do I ask it, with your fervent prayers for Your own Sister. Ellen Sr Baptiste Sup[End Page 4]"
