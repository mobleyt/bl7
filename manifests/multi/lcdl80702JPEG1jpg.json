      "value": "Geneva October 13th 1827\n\nMy dear sir,\n\nYour favour of 27th Sept, was received\nlast evening. For it and the [illegible], and the favourable\nopinion you express of any discourses, and beg you to\naccept my respectful acknowledgements.\n\nThe limits to which I was obliged to [illegible]\nmy [illegible] in my address, did not permit and to price our e-\nlaborate augment are [clerical?] learning. I think we\nare not quite so far apart as you suppose on this sub-\nhect. Classical learning is not \"indispensable\", nor [illegible]\nvery important to [illegible] but [mercilous?] of the learned pro-\nfessions, and those who design to denote themselves to those\naccept literacy and [illegible] investigation. Even in the\nlearned professions, those who are content to [accompany?] the\n[illegible] may do without [illegible] and without\n[illegible] latin, but I am fully of opinion, that those who \nare determined to [illegible] in the front [rank?]\nof the professions, will find it unnecessary to be deeply \n[illegible] with ancient as well as modern learning.\nMy plan is that the best spirits should unite both, and I\nthink they promise to be the leaders of [illegible] who do so.\n[If?] your discourses on codification, which is as beautiful\nin style as it is valuable in power of augment, your\nhand given He’s [illegible] of what can be said on this sub-\nject. I own [illegible]. How you\nread Sir W. Scott’s argument on the subject his life of\n[illegible]? In your last discourse, you have elaborate-\nly and cleanly developed the great principles and tendency\nof the protestant reformation. Does not this discourse\nrather [illegible] He’d read on to [illegible] that ancient and \n[illegible] learning way if it be united? I sincerely thank\nyou for their valuable discourses and agree with your\nbrother in many things he has said, but no in this\n[instance?]. I especially agree with him in what he\nhas said of teaching [latin?]. by making the scholar acquaint\ned with the best specimen of it, rather than by a for-\nmal [traction?], The same idea is intimated in Any dis-\ncourse, I will send your brother a copy, and you may ex-\npect two by the way of mail.\n\nI am my sincerely glad to see a pros-\npectus for a Law [illegible] Review.\n\n[End page 1]\n\nThe [illegible] is a duty which the people of the southern\nstates [cause?] to themselves. It will afford a [illegible] of [illegible]\nknown your own views and defending your own in\nsituations, which I hope you will do elaborately, temperately\nbut energetically. I will [subscribe?] myself and will\nbeg you to have my name entered for that [purpose?], and\nwill endeavour to procure the [illegible] of [course?] [otherwise?],\nI cannot say, however, that I have [much?] hope of\nsuccess.\n\nI [observe?] that is the [illegible], constitutional and\nis a adverted to, I have given considerable attention to this\nsubject and since I have [keen?] [hand?], and have made myself\nacquainted [illegible] this [illegible] with the [respects?] of [Dallas?],\n[Grand?] and Wheaton, as far as constitutional cases, and cases\nbelonging to the law of nations are concerned, The\nSupreme Court has, in my judgment, carried the doctrine\nof [construction?] as [far?] as it will hear, still I am\nnot convinced that it has carried it too far. I have read\nDr. [illegible] this subject. Some of his assertions\nand [illegible] do not appear to use either historically or\npolitically, [illegible], the constitution of the U.S. in the [Chains?]\nof a system which has been and must continue to be developed\nby [degrees?], I have [illegible] idea of collecting materials\nfor a complete constitutional, History of the U.S.,\nand of digesting them into orders beginning with the ideas of\nthe settlers of this country are this subject as far as\nthey can be collected, taking a rapid view of this colonial\ncharters by the [grant?], and of this constitutional legislation,\ntracing this history of the union aborigine will\nreference to this [paint?], giving a history of the old [confederation?]\nand of the [illegible] of the present constitution,\nand following this course of legislative, execution\nand judicial construction on this celebrated instrument\nI hope that in the first number of the So. [Southern?] Review\nyou will give a full view of the grounds of the anti-\ntariff policy for which the S. [Southern] states contend. I am preparing\nlectures on political [Economy?], and should be\nglad to see a full article abounding in facts and sound\narguments on the anti-tariff side of this question.\nI wish you had informed me that your\ncitizens had associated to raise\nup a first-rate\n\n[End page 2]\n\ncollege as well as Review in your city, and have a [strange?]\nattachment to Charleston, and cannot cease to feel an\ninterest in its College. As I often said when I was\nthere, what an advantage it would be to the\ncity and to the state, if 25 could be graduated at that\ninstitution annually. What an immense addition\nto this [world?] power of the [community?]. It has\nbeen matter of [regret?], that I did not make [illegible]\nacquaintance with you until the latter part\nof my residence in Charleston. If I could\nhave found a half dozen who would have\nmanifested the zeal of your self, I should not\nhave [despaired?] of success. Perhaps I despaired too\nsoon, It is certain, that if I had known this favorable\ndistinction of the inhabitants towards us\nand the college before and engaged to cause [illegible], I \nshould not have [illegible] so. I find this climate\ntoo cold for me. I was unwell during [illegible]\nof the last winter, and fear I shall be so again.\nMy present intention is to remove to a milder\nclimate as soon as there is [an?] opening\nfor me in a first-rate institution. I wish the\ncitizens of Charleston would make their College\nsuch an institution, and I cannot doubt,\nthat you and a dozen gentlemen with whom\nyou generally associate, might do this by entering\nupon the project boldly, energetically and\nwith a fierce determination to be discouraged\nby no common obstacles.\n\nWhatever in this relates to names or delicate\nsubjects, I beg you will consider confidential.\nAlso when your Review is published, will you take\nthe copy designed fo use and mark with a pencil at the\nhead of each article the name of the author. If possible\nand shall sometimes send you an article\nfor the work\n\n[End page 3]\n\nI am very respectfully your friend and\nObet. [Obedient] [Servant?]\n\nJ. Adams\n\n[To:] The Honourable\nThomas S. Grimke\nCharleston\nS. Carolina\n\n[Postmarked:] Geneva October 14\n\n[From:] Revd [Reverend] Jasper Adams\n\n[End page 4]"
