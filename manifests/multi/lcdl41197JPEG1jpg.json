  "label": "Our worst editor. Joseph Pulitzer, and his opinion of Life.",
  "description": "Caricature of Joseph Pulitzer published in the March 9, 1899, edition of Life. The associated article reads : \"The editor of the World is known wherever bad English is read, and depraved minds everywhere hail him as a source of inspiration. He has probably done more harm to morals, and has fostered with more real persistency the rapid undergrowth of American degeneracy than any other living man. What he might say of Life is therefore of great interest : 'Don' speag to me of Life. Dot paper is der worst ever, ain't it? Ven de Sun un Churnal un udder file sheets gome out against me, I laf ha-ha! Vat does it madder? But Life! Dot paper goes to der very peoples dot I vould buy myselluf a place among, because of my monish, un day vill not have me, Hah! It has cut into my cirgulation also, un made me a laughing stock. It makes me sick. Speag to me not of Life.' Mr. Pulitzer's views, though not new, may well bear reiterating, showing, as they do, that no refined family of taste can afford not to take Life regularly. Contrast the shame-faced individual with some grains of self-respect left who stealthily endeavors to conceal a copy of the World from sight, and the proud bearing of the man who spreads his Life where all may see the company he keeps. Merely to be seen with a copy of Life is a good mind advertisement.\"",
