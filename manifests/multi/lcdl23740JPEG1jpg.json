Excerpt from Institute for Southern Studies, Vol.12. Winter 1965: \"While on Comingtee names, there is the usual Ball ghost here, this one with the unusual name of the \"Robintation Tree.\" It is a tree which the Negroes claim to be haunted and upon which they bestowed the name, but why \"Robintation\" no one seems to know. A picture of this tree appears in the illustrated article on Comingtee by Mrs. White and Mrs. Rose.\"  An additional part of the legend is that there is an Indian chief buried at the foot of the tree.  As long as the tree remains untouched, no serious harm would befall whoever lived on the property.",
