      "value": "Francis Lynch Cheraw 21 Mar 1864 Dear Brother, Your letter to Father was received as also, the one written on before leaving the city to which I replied to you at Richmond. I also wrote to Col. Northrop as yet have had no reply. Though I suppose the Govt will exempt myself [illegible] my enlistment or they must be closed. You are aware the State Legislature passed an act taxing manufactured objects in kind. The liberal definition placed on this act by our worthy Atty. Gnl led me to hope it would work fairly. In my own case, this claim [?] made to the Board showed the shoed & Boots +c [illegible] to over 10,000 prs the part of the duty of those and Some other amt to 186,500 $ The shares of that year having been sold in I respectfully submitted to the Board that for their [illegible] value (the sum they [illegible] me as above), I was taxable 5pct making a tax of $9.325. This I propose to pay in money or of more desirable furnish [illegible] at 20c pr pair in payment of it. The Board suggested 700 pr of these shoes[End Page 1] for the tax, to which I assented. At this period of the proceedings, one of the members of the Board took the ground that the Board was entitled to Boots, Shoes and everything else in the like, to the extent of 5pct in quantity - regardless of what they produced in Sales and argued that the sale of such articles (when not suited to the wants of soldiers families) would bring a large amt of money at the present value of them, And by a bare majority of the Board carried his point. There will be an effort at the next meeting, to set the matter right, for some members of the Board are more of business, and see the wrong its present action would make in organizing a tax on value of near $30,000--on sales of 186,500--, while of this amount is included [illegible] 2300 pr that I have furnished to the Govmt in exchange for Hides, [illegible] shoes for every 6# Hides--and fixing the price 20 $ & $48,300. The interest you have evinced in this matter has led me to apprize you of its working. If the visit entertained by me in regard to it is consent I would like to have the approval of the Atty Genrl unofficially. I was glad to learn thro Mr [illegible] of your good health & hope soon you will visit us all well and join a love & begging your affect prayers. F. Lynch[End Page 2]"
