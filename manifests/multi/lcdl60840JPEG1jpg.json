      "value": "Charleston Nov[November] 1st 1830.\nDear Aunt\nMr. Gibbes informed me that you wished to know what money of yours I have at present in my \nhandes. I received at different times from Mr. Gibbes Six hundred and seventy one dollars, $1162,92 was expended in settling Dr.[Doctor] Mannings Bill and purchasing the articles you first sent for; the carriage [and] horses with the expences on the road asccounted[sic] to about $520. There was also about Ten dollars spent in purchasing some articles which you sent down to Mr. Gibbes to procure, but as I had all your money at that time he sent the list to me. I recollect two dozen handkerchiefs, and some silk were among the articles, I think, however, a statement of what they came to was sent up at the same time with them. All of which amount to $640 or thereabouts, leaving in my hands, including $10 my mother had of yours previously, 37 dollars. As you wish to know, I preserve what are your funds in town I will mention that the dividend on your share, which was due in \nbeen drawn out by my Father but he can receive them at any time, it amounts to Ten Dollars and a half. I had nearly forgot to mention that to Mr. Gibbes passed over all the money which remained after making purchases for you into my hands, saying when he did so that as you would be sending down occasionally to me to execute courmissions[sic] it would be more convenient for me to keep the money. \nI am glad to hear my dear Aunt that your health is somewhat better than it was, and that you avail yourself of the carriage for exercise. I saw the Coachman who carried up\n [end page one]\n the carriage who informed me he had lately been to Pendleton where he saw you and that during his stay there you visited several places in the neighbourhood. Suppose my cousins have become pretty expert drivers by this time and are now perfectly accostomed[sic] to the horses. All the family are well with the exception of Ann and her little boy, she took a violent cold on the Island and he has had a fever, but they are both considerably better; Mr. Taylor has gone to Johns Island.  Sister Mary is now at the Island where she has driven to on the appearance of the fever of which there have been a few cases. Charles and Emma with Julia are also well. My Mother asks if you received her letter which she wrote a fortnight since she desires her love to yourself and my cousins in which I cordially join.\n Yours Affectionately,\n P.[Peter] Manigault\n[End page two]\nMiss H.A. Drayton\nPendleton Village\nSouth Carolina\n[End page three]"
