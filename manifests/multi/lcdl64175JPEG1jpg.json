      "value": "[Abraham Lott to Nathanael Greene\nOctober 24, 1778\n[RvW Box 2 Folder 46; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\nBeverwyck  Oct.r 24th. 1778\nMy dear Sir\nThe uncertainty of finding you \nafter the raising of the Blockade at Rhode Island\nprevented my troubling you with any of my Letters.\nbut finding by your much esteemed favor of the\n19th Instant, which came to hand two Days ago,\nthat you had returned to Fredricksburgh [sic], I could\nnot let slip the favorable conveyance by Colo –\nMorris to Acknowledge receipt thereof –\nCol.o [Colonel] Livingston , as you suppose, as well\nas some other of my friends have given me an\naccount of the Rhode Island Expedition , and the\nconcurring circumstances, which were the causes\nof its miscarriage – Most people seem to blame\nthe Comte d'Estaing  for quitting New Port so preci-\n-pitately, and blame him totaly solely for the\nfailure of the Expedition. – However that may\nbe, I must own that I think he moved off rather\nsooner than he need have done, and that we\nshould have taken the place, and made the whole\nGarrison Prisoners of war, with the whole of the\nEnemies Stores, if he had remained but 24 hours\nlonger before the place – Could we have\nSucceeded in this, the whole British Army in\nNew York, must in my opinion, also have fallen\ninto our hands – The consequences of which\nwould have been that Britain would have\nbeen glad to make peace with us on such\nTerms as we should dictate. – It is therefore\nnot to be won and at that some people are a little \nvociferous, against Monsr. Le Compte d'Estaing.\t\n[End Page 1]\nI am greatly obliged to Genl. [General] [and] Mrs\nHancock  for their remembrance of me – They showed\nme the greatest marks of attention while I was\nat Boston, and [I] rank them among the most\nvirtuous Citizens – It is true they live high,\nbut I do not think them Tinctured  with the\nprevailing vices of the Town, mentioned by you,\n[and] which I also was an Eye Witness to. Indeed\nI went so far as to mention to some of my friends\nthat I expected from what I had always heard\nto find a pius Religious set of people, but\nto my surprize found very little remains of it\namongst them – A sad foreboding this, that\nin times of danger and universal distress, Vice\ninstead of Virtue should prevail, and Especially\namong a people formerly highly esteemed for\ntheir moral, as well as Religious professions\n- I pray God may not in his great displeasure\npunish the Land for these growing Abomi-\n-nations, but may turn the hearts of all its\nInhabitants to do what is truely [sic] praise\n-worthy, and acceptable to him.\nMrs. Livingston  is perfectly recovered, and\nhope to have the pleasure of seeing her here shortly –\nCol.o [Colonel] Bill  has sent his Resignation to his\nExcellency, which for the sake of his wife, I hope\nmay be Accepted – He and I expect to set out\nfor Phila next Monday, but do not mean to\nmake any stay there.\nI sincerely congratulate you upon the \nbirth of another Daughter , and cannot but be\n[End Page 2]\nProud that you mean to honor my Daughter\nCornelia, with naming the child after her. Be\npleased to present our compliment to Mrs. Greene\nupon her happy delivery, and accept my\nwishes that the Child may live [and] be a comfort\nto you both – Mrs. Livingston has also, lately\nbeen brought to Bed with a son, who for\nhis age is a promising lad. –\nYou cannot doubt of my wishes to meet\nyou in New York soon, - But tho we have\nreason from every information to believe that \n[the] Enemy are preparing to quit that City, I\n[MS. blotted] make myself believe they will go off\n[MS. blotted] altogether this Autumn; but\n[MS. blotted] other think they will keep pos-\n[-session] of that place as long as they\n[po]ssibly can. – I hope I may be\n[MS. blotted] and that we may take each other\n[MS. blotted] there soon.\nOur army moving from White Plains\nshortly after I quitted the Camp [and] having been\nin no fixed place since, I have not had an\nopportunity to send of my [?] yet – Pray\nwill you do me the favor to let me know\nwhether, if I send it to Fishkill , any empty\nreturn wagons to Boston can be got to take it\nto that place, and where it ought to be at Fishkill[?]\nMrs. Lott [and] the family, present their best\nrespects to you with those of –\nDear Gen. l [General]\nYour most obed.t  Servt [obedient Servant]\nAbrm [Abraham] Lott\n[End Page 3]\n[Addressed:] The Honorable\nMajor Genl. N. Greene [General Nathanael Greene]\nat\nFavored by          Headquarters \nCol.o [Colonel] Morris        Fredricksburgh [sic]\n[Endorsed upside down:]  A. Lott Esqr. [Abraham Lott Esquire]\n24.
