The debts and legacies of the Testator shall be paid immediately from the residuary estate: the will shall be construed as declaring the Residuary estate to be primarily liable for such payment, and the Bonds, Stocks, Cash and other residue shall immediately be applied accordingly.  Article 2. The Devise to Henrietta [I.?] C., the testator's granddaughter of the three Lots in Wraggsborough, shall be deemed to be extinguished by the sale made of them in Testators lifetime: but the Legacy to the said Henrietta of Ten Thousand Dollars, shall be considered as compensatory for benefits released by her heirs, and shall stand as though [?] a Legacy bequeathed to those who are now her Distributees: and the said Charles Heyward agrees to pay the said sum to the Distributors of the said Henrietta and charges the same upon his Amsterdam Plantation in the same form, as if he had now repeated the Testator's language to that effect.  Article 3. The legacy to Mrs Keith of Daniel Heywards Bond shall be construed to include as well Five thousand    [End Page 1] Dollars. which is now due on the Bond, as the further sum of Five thousand Dollars paid on the said Bond to the testator, in his lifetime: it being believed to be the intention to give the whole Ten thousand Dollars  Article 4. The crop in the hands of the Factors of the last year, together with all proceeds of Rice of last year's crop sold, or to be sold, shall be deemed assets of the Estate, and shall fall into the residue: but it is agreed that from these assets shall be paid the plantation expenses of the whole current year of all the plantations and negroes to be delivered up according to the next article. By Plantation expenses, are meant Taxes, Overseers wages, Physician's Bill, and food and clothing of the negroes.  Article 5. The Executors do hereby expressly assent, to the Legacies given to the parties to these presents, and acknowledge that they have delivered possession, this day of the property real and personal devised and bequeathed to each of them. And the said Charles Heyward, do the assent to the legacies given to William H Heyward, and doth acknowledge that he hath delivered to him exclusive possession of all the property devised and bequeathed to him: And the said William H Heyward, doth assent to the legacies given to Charles Heyward, and doth acknowledge that he hath delivered to him exclusive possession of all the real and personal property devised and bequeathed to him.  And the said William H Heyward doth appoint the said Charles Heyward, his agent to manage and conduct the lands  [End Page 2] and negroes of him, the said William for the remainder of the present year, until the crop be harvested and got out. And the other parties do appoint Wm H Heyward and Charles Heyward, their agents jointly to manage their lands and negroes for the same time, and purpose. And the first day of December next, shall be assumed as the final period at which all the agencies shall terminate.  Article 6th. In case Mr Arthur Heyward, one of the residuary legatees, shall object to any of these arrangements, and shall proceed to make Charles Heyward liable, the other parties agree to indemnify Mr Charles Heyward, severally and respectively in proportion, to the respective interests which they take under the Will, for any reclamation to be established by reason of his departing in their favor from the course prescribed by the Law. Witness our hands and seals this 7th June 1851 [End Page 3] Agreement for Settling the Estate of Nathl. Heyward. June 7th 1851 [End Page 4]"
