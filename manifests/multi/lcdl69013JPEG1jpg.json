      "value": "Monday -\n8 A.M.\n564 PARK AVENUE\nDear Sidney,\nHow I hated to\nleave on that 7 P.M. train\nfrom Westerley! - All the\nway doen in the train\nI watched that big golden\nmoon come up into the \nsky [and] by the time I\nreached the tall buildings\nof New York it was shining\ndown orange [and] full on the\nugly roof tops below -\nI wondered how you were\nspending that full moon\nevening - I wondered if you\nwere looking at it [and]\nthinking about me -\nperhaps wishing I was with\nyou on a beach or under the\npalms - I hope so.\n[End Page 1]\nI wonder how you spent\nSunday?\nYou did n't tell me what\nyou did last Sunday - 11th\nor the two Sunday before the 4th -\nYour last letter was the\nfifth but you only talked\nof me, [and] my going to London\n[and] so I do hope you will\ntell me about you.\nThe air was so lovely up there\nat Watch Hill, although we had\nthick fog Sunday morning, it\ncleared off in the afternoon [and]\nit was sunny [and] hot all afternoon\non the beach -\nBo came out in an adorable sun\nsuit with a big pink bow\nin the rear [and] was the most\ncomplimented child you ever \nsaw - I wish you could see\nher - she is a picture! The cutest\ntrick you ever laid your eyes on\njust a big walking doll with\nbeady black flashing eyes -\n[and] a wonderful face - she\nis so far [and] away the most\nattractive child up there\n[End Page 2]\namongst that group of some fifty children\nthat every one talks to her [and] says Hello.\nMiss Evans guards their spoiling her as\nmuch as possible - but she is desperately cunning.\n[and] we could eat her up - [and] if I say so - it\nmust be true - because I do not die over children\nor get excited about them as most mothers.\nWell Bunny Lambert Loyd was up there -\nShe told me you [and] Morris taught her Sunday\nschool at Princeton. Did you put on that\ndeep reverent priests voice when you taught her\nthe commandments? I know you had taught\nswimming in Lake Forest, been Life guards at\nAntibes but I never knew you taught Sunday school.\nBunny was very nice I thought, [and] is one of the\nvery few girls I have met who really misses\nher husband - Most of the gals around-\nlike the freedom [and] holliday, have beauxs\n[and] generally are charmed with hell rousing.\nBunny is really in love with Stacy\n[and] misses him. It was a relief to meet some one who was.\nThere is a gal in my office whom you would\nnot remember - She is very pretty, very feminine\n[and] can turn on the oil, sugar, butter [and] soft songs\nlike nobody - she batts her eye lids, [and] talks\nsweetness - under neath it all she is the\nmost vitriolic, scheming, calculating, cold\nbitt of a woman - I have ever met - I have\nwatched her work now for many months and\n[End Page 3]\n564 PARK AVENUE\n2\nand her motives that lie\nbehind everything she does\nis so [illegible] - is frightening.\nSince I have watched her she\nhas made a play for\nfour different men - one\nright after the other - [and] whether\nthey are happily married or\nnot is of no consequence -\nshe works on them all the\ntime in the office - then\nhas dinners for them at night.\nOf course in summer non of \nthe wives are in Washington\nso she really goes to town -\nIncidently Bunny's husband\nwas one of her victims last\nwinter before he was sent abroad\n[End page 4]\n[and] to hear this gal talk you\nwould think Bunny [and] Stacy\nwere not getting on [and] were\non the brink of divorce -\nNow that I know differently,\nI think even less than ever\nof this \"man crazy siren\".\nin my next letter I will\ntell you her name although\nI dont think it will mean\nanything to you - \nShe is working on Russ now\nwhile Ada is at the beach\nwith the kids.\nWell darling its getting hot already,\n[and] I am sure it will be a scorcher\nby lunch time -\nI am off to see Erickson, the\nBank, etc etc. I shall go see Mr.\nDent to.\nThen to Katherine's for the\nnight [and] Washington again\nto-morrow.\nMy bathing suits were \nso lovely to lie around in \n[End Page 5]\n[and] I was sunk not to be able to go in swimming.\nSuch bad luck!\nLandine [and] Bixie were having a great\ntime to gether [and] I have never seen Landine\nso gay, happy [and] care free - She was\nbeing completely independant [and] eating\nlike a horse -\nI have no dope yet as to when\nmy boat sails, how soon, or what\nsize - I am already - packed\n[and] waiting [and] when I get my\npass port to-morrow - I am going\nto ask [and] see if I can't go to\nWatch Hill [and] wait for orders\ninstead of staying on in the Washington\noffice - After all I have had no\nholliday - which after all everyone is\nsupposed to be entitled to each year -\nWill you be given leave on the\nisland?- or no leave at all?-\nIt's too bad they won't let you pay\nfor your own trip to the mainland - so\nit would n't cost the Navy anything.\nAll my love darling goes to you - its\nwith you constantly - I can't wait for your letters,\n[and] I live for this war to end -\nGertie\n[End Page 6]"
