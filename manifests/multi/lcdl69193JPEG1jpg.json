      "value": "January 28, 1943\nHello Sweetears,\nI am writting you from my apartment as I have\ngiven up hope of being able to do so from the office. There\nis to much going on and everytime I take a sheet of paper in\nmy hand and insert it into this old machine and start a letter\nto you I end up by endorsing someones orders or ordering a\nton of mimeograph paper for our grinding presses.\nYour letter of the 18th. arrived on the morning\nmail and I was so delighted to receive it and read everything\nyou said over twice[,]before the captain came out and seeing me\nwith an[un]officeial paper in my hand scowled heavily. I think it\nis so mean to leave you in America and send people like Helen\nto England when you have had more experience travelling and know\nforeign lands better than anyone else. I cannot tell you what\nto do to get one of those swell jobs because I am not any good\nat it myself. Now if the Fuherer was there he would probably\nhandle you so that Persia would be the first stopping off place\nwithin the week. This I do know that the old saw of \"it is who\nyou know and not what youknow \" is as true today as it was the\nhour it was coined back in the garden of Eden. To be liked\nby everyone is far better than to have the strongest character\nin the world and all sorts of ambition, if ones ambition is to\nget ahead quickly. Of course I do believe that ability wins\nout in the long run, but what a run. There is hardly any\nbreath left in the body at the end . As I told you in a former\nletter you must not sit in that dreary city and wait for me to\ncome back because no one, I least of all know what my plans are\ngoing to be. I think, simply because I cannot imagine anything\nelse[,]that we will move up to our new building and be the\nadministrative officers there, but this may not come ture as\none of our units numbers into the thousands, rather hundreds of\nmen with a captain at the head and two commanders as excutiove\nand administrative officers. Now our captain may go to sea as\nhe has been trying to for months. In that case the other captain\nwould undoubtly take charge and Morris and I would be out as\nadministrators and would apply for a transfer. Then only the\nLord and the Navy Dept. would know where we would be sent. Past\nperformances mean nothing in sending one to a new post now.\nThe procedure is that when a new man is needed they grab the first\navailable one and send him on regar[d]less of whether he knows what\nthe hell it is all about.\nI had a good laugh when I read your letter\nsaying you thought the war would now go on for two more years.\nJust a month ago washington thought that it was all over and\nonly the spoils of victory remained to be divided, now they\nthink it will take two years and within a month they will\n[End Page 1]\nwonder when it will end. I predict 1945. Germany is still\ndeep in Russia, she has not been driven out of Africa by a\nlong shot, her submarine warfare is only commencing and she\nmay try a pincer movement down through Turkey herself. Somehow\nI do not see why she should be defeated when she is fighting on\nher home soil any faster than Russia was. It must be remembered\nthat in the last war at the time the Armistice was signed she\nwas deep in France and her troops were doing very well indeed.\nIt was the crumbling of the home and not the war front that\nforced her surrender. Today with the existing powerful\npropaganda machine she will be able to maintain a higher morale\nand conseqently will be more difficult to defeat.\nSurely Gertie now that you have been in Washington\nfor so long you must know some of the powers that be, you have\nwritten me of dinners at which you have met them. Won't they\nhelp you obtain an overseas job, give you something to do that\nwould interest you and use your strength and abiltiy to their\nfullest. It does seem a shame to keep you cooped up in that\nhot dreary office all the time when you might be somewhere\nenjoying the climate as I am even though you may not have a\nbetter job.\nWe went surfboading today and It was wonderful.\nThe water was jade in color and very clear so that sitting on\nones board you could l[o]ok down and see nobs of coral and seaweed\nthat swung back and forth as if blown by the wind. The waves\nwere too small and broke sharply so that it was difficult to\ncatch them. I had been swept ashore by one and was paddling\nout again when I heard Morris the fat face whoop and saw him\npaddling like mad in fron_t of a big comber. It caught up and\nlifting the back end of his board started it sliding down the\nsmooth green surface of the wave,. Little lines of white formed\non either side of the bow as it cut through the water and as\nthe wave broke the xxxxxxxxxxxxx foam of the crest swept forward\nand encirled the board halfxxx its length. Morris stood up\nand as he came towards me I yelled \"beach boy, beach boy \"\nderiously . He waved his hand and this threw him off his balance\nfor a moment he tettered back and forth and then with a forlorn\nyell fell over backwards and the board shot up int o the air.\nA moment latter he emerged with that wonderful grin on his face\nsaying \"Boy oh Boy, did you see me\". We stayed out for on hour\nand were so tired when we grounded our boards on the white sand\nin front of the club that we had to sit there for five minutes\nin order that we might have sufficent strength to pick them up\nand curry them to thier lockers. The boards weigh a hundred\npounds and it is quite a trick to lift and handle them. Only\nold time Hawniians like us of course are [A]ble to do so. I will\nadmit that seeing you know me very well that when no one is\nlooking Morris takes one end of the board and I the other and\nwe carry it together. This is of course disgraceful, but we\nare past the age of caring.\nThe saddest sight I have seen in years is at the\nBOQ. There by the front door is a car its tires flat, its\nradiator covered with vines which have twined around the hood,\n[End Page 2]\ncrept into the interior through the windows and wrapped around\nthe steering wheel. I asked whose car it was and the answer,\nan aviators killed at Guadalcan[A]l. No one does anything about\nit, waiting for the Goverment to take charge, so there it sits\na green covered tombstone to his memeory. It will probably be\nthere at the end of the war, only then the vine will have swallowed\nit completely and only the radio antennae will be pointing up\nupwards.\nThe noise in front of out building is unbelievable.\nThree weeks ago they laid a new street with the aid of tractors ,\ndrills and extra loud whistles. All trafficX was shunted around\na tiny road in the course of which it became hopelessly snarled.\nFor the past three days they have been tearing up this road with\nthe same tractors, recognized several of the men driving them.\nThe extra loud whis[T]les are there in better condition than ever,\nand trafficX is now so tied up that some cars have not moved for\ndays. I like to see things like this happen. It reminds me of\nthe frustrations at Medway and priv[u]des a very homy touch. One\nrealizes that war or no war street depts. are the final arbiters\nof our lives, and that they remain supreme long after conquerors\nhave crumbled in the dust.\nEvery Hawaiian newspaper pleaded with one to be at\nthe radio at 4:30 to hear an extraordinary announcemnt. Morris\nand I thought the war was going to end, taxes seduced, taxes\nraised, ten acres and a mule for every man in the service etc.\nso we left the office and sat by a radio. You can imagine our\nrage when we heard that simple announcement that was meant to\nsend the blood coursing through our veins. The President had\nbeen travelling again. This time he had been to North Africa,\na very good place in the winter when icy blasts are blowing down\nconstitution avenue. Best of all I liked Stalins and Chiang KI\nCheks remark that they were too busy fighting to talk.\nGood bye darling, I will write you everyother day\nfrom the apartment at night, and I send you all my best wishes\nand love for a job that you will like and that we will be\ntogether soon.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 3]"
