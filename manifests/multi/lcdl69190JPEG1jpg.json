      "value": "To\nMrs Sidney J. Legendre,\nO.S.S. Detachment,\nA.P.O NO. 887\nPostermastern New York.\nFrom \nLt. S. Legendre, USNR\nPO Box 166, Commandant\nNavy No. 128\nFleet PO San Francisco\nJanuary 23, 1944\n87\nDear Gertie,\nYour letter of January 4, just arrived telling about you\nwonderful weekend in the country ever NewYears eve with Lester and David\nand it sounded heavenly. That big fat spaniel in the hall the size of a\nheifer must have been wonderful and I could picutre the peace and loveliness\nof the old inn, the fire, champagne and wonderful stories about Africa.\nI am so glad you had a good time and hope that many more week ends will\ncome by for you like that one.\nWe have had a funny week end ourselves. Today being Sunday\nMorris of course went to the office but he returned at two oclock because \nwe had an appintment with the women who is to run our apartment house for\nus. She works with the Hawaiian Trust Co. This co. makes a speciality\nof managing apartment houses which takes the load off out shoulders and \nalso avoids the worries and annoyances that we saw only to clearly would\nbe our lot should we try to manage the house ourselves. Today we went\naround with her to see al the tennants and it was hysterical. Morris had\nhis best go to meeting manner and was running for mayor in a big way.\nThe first aprtment we went into was owned by a women of about forty five\nwho immediately lit into us and said that her apartment was filthy , she\nwanted it done over, the walls repainted, new drapes and less noise in the\nneighborhood. Morris smiled his sweetest smile bowed low when she was thru\nand we went out. Our apartment manager said when we had closed the door\nshall I start have that work done right away. \"Hell no \" Morris said\n\"do nothing, we dont want her in here. Do nothing.\" As we passed her\na artment latter she stuck her head out of the door again and said \"and\nI want my screens fixed.\" Morris replied \"Madam I can promise you that\nwithin a short time you will not have anything in this apartment to complain\nabout\" which was very true. Many of the aprtments are occupied by defenc se\nworkers who are filthy. They come home in their greasy clothes sit down\nin the chairs and lie on the beds so that grease is over everything. W\nAre also going to try and get them out and secure better tennants but the\nlaw out here does not let you put a person out of an apartment of house\nif they are already occuping it. Unless you yourself are going to live \nthere. As we evidently cannot live in all the aprtments at onxe time we\nmay run into a little trouble, but that is something that we will and see.\nWe have already arranged to have an landscape archestect come out on\nThursday to adivse us on the planting of vines, palm trees flowers to\nmake the place more attractive and a contract is being prepared with a\nfloor poslihsing co.to polish all the floors, wax the red concrete halls\nand entrance. Morris os of course in his element and you can be sure is\ndam good at it. Unfortunately the newspapers printed the fact that we\nhad purchased this apartment house on their frontpages and this has caused\nan avalnche of calls as to whether we have an aprtment for rent. Captains\nand commanders who did [illegible] before stop us now and say \"\nGood mor ing my boy, h[illegible] have an aprtment for rent\nSidney Legendre"
