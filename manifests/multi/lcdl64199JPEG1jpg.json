      "value": "[Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer to Unknown\nMay 22, 1781\n[RvW Box 2 Folder 55; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\t\t\nPhila. May 22d. 1781.\nMy dear Sir,\nI see by the paper you were so kind as to inclose me\nthat the Tub is again thrown out to the Whale. Dissention is always the\nmother of distress and if I mistake not we shall have enough of it before\nChristmass [sic]. General Green[e]s not succeeding before Cambden will in\nsome measure dispirit our men, [and] perhaps prevent future confidence\nand the British will be highly elated altho we did not lose more in\nkilled wounded [and] missing than 160 men [and] having taken near\nthree hundred at their different outPosts in SC including 50 taken by Col\nWashington's Horse at Camden. General Green[e] informs Congress that\nhe should have gained a Compleat Victory had not two Companys of\nthe first Maryland Reg.t been thrown in to disorder wch occasioned Col\nGunby to change his Position, the second Reg.t conceiving this movement to be a retreat\nfollowed, the confusion it occasioned obliged the General to order a Retreat\nHe lost neither Arms Ammunition or baggage, [and] says that it would make\nno alteration in his plan his letter is dated the 27th of April but ‘tis said\nthe 30th. he was at Rugeleys Mill about 12 Miles from Camden.\nNo appearance of the arrival of the Second Division, I believe it is gone\nto the West Indias [sic] [and] I suppose will not be with us till the Hurricanes\nmaybe expected. What is meant by this delay God knows, but I fear\nsome cursed mischief is hatching against us in Europe. Mr. Cumberland\nwas at Madrid so late as the 9th of March from thence he was to proceed\nin a few days to Paris. little or no aid from the Court of Spain, some\npromisses [sic] on certain Conditions.  The Minister has received important\ndispatches from the Court of France by a Frigate arrived at Boston\nHe is soon to communicate part of their contents to Congress, but from\nhis delay I fear that they will not revive our Spirits much. Not a word\nfrom Docr. Franklin which induces me to believe that he was not\napprized of her destination.\nMr. Morris has accepted of the Office of Finan\ncier the principal part of his Plan is a Grand Bank. I am in great hopes of relief\nfrom his ability [and] industry. You will I expect have the whole Scheme\nsent from the Prest. of Congress to our assembly by next Post. All Paper\n[End Page 1]\nwill I expect be called in, as every Emission, be the foundation [?]\ngood is immediately depreciated [and] the unwarry ruined by it. I \nfear that the late Fleet that sailed from New York is before this time\narrived in our Bay with 2000 Soldiers, as it was seen four days\nago off the Capes of Delaware. The Southern States I fear will be ruined\nby piece Meals, if this happens [which God avert] the Northern [States] will soon\nshow the same fate.\nWhat are your Delegates in Congress to do for Subsistence they\nare without Money [and] will soon be without Credit. If the assembly or the\nCouncil would order some wheat to be ground at the Head of the Bay\ninto superfine Flour it would command Hard Money [and] nothing\nelse will pass here but on the most ruinous terms. Mr. Joseph Gilpin\nwould undertake [and] execute this business with fidelity [and] dispatch. Col. [Colonel] Hollingsworth\nhas too much on his hands to allow him to pay proper attention to this\nsupply.\nPresent me to your Lady [and] believe me as ever\nYour affectionate friend.\nDan of St. Thos Jenifer [Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer]\n[P.S.]\nGeneral Washington left Head Quarters on Saturday\nto meet the Count de Rochambeau to settle the plan of operation \nfor this Campaign\nRemember me to our late Governor\n[End Page 2]"
