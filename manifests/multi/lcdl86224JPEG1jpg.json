  "description": "A postcard of the mural from the main lobby of the Fort Sumter Hotel that depicts the attack on Fort Sumter. The front of the postcard reads, \"This mural painting, in the Main Lobby of the Fort Sumter Hotel, Charleston, South Carolina, symbolizes the initial attack by Confederate forces, beginning the War Between the States.--The painting is by Alfred Hutty, internationally noted artist and etcher.\" The back of the postcard reads, \"The first shot of the War Between the States was fired April 12, 1861, from a Confederate battery at Fort Johnson (position of the observer in this painting) and landed on the parade ground of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. In this painting Fort Sumter is center, Fort Moultrie to the distant left and a floating Confederate battery to the right. The flag is the original seven star flag of the Confederacy. Fort Sumter, occupied by Confederates on April 14, 1861, was under constant siege by Federal forces from that date until February 18, 1865--In 1948 Fort Sumter was designated a national monument.\"",
