      "value": "Charleston April 11/66. Maj T. B. Ferguson Dean Hall Dear Sir. Yours of 9th came to hand by Mr. Edwards yesterday morning. The cog wheel could not be cast at either Easons or Henreys before today. We thought best to have two cast to prevent delay in the event of a similar accident to one again he may only get one ready in time for the train tonight. W. Edwards will take with him one side of leather for Hames Stingis. The oil and tallow will go up by the Sch: R E Lee now loading. She will also take up the Timber Wheels and carts and two boxes of Iron and one box additional of harness from it. of which should complete your order. I am in treaty with seven carpenters, how many will conclude to go to you I cannot say at this time. those that do conclude to go, propose going up tomorrow night. I suppose you had better send a cart for them. The Schooner that went up for the lumber has returned to town. I have not learned from your brothers what arrangement has been made about the lumber she took in. I know he intends to have the money for it or libel the vessel. Respy yours Wm. McBurney [End Page 1] April 11th 1866 Wm McBurney [End Page 2]"
