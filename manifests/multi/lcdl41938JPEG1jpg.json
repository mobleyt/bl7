      "value": "A.M.D.G Ursuline Convent & Acadmey \"Valle Crucis\"--near Columbia S.C. April 6th 1866 My dearest Brothers, Revd Dr Meriwether arrived safely at home this evening & gave us the pleasing intelligence of your good health, & pleasant enjoyment of the Rector's visit with the Genls A & S around the Bay. Mrs. Cory [?] wrote us, that you were to give confirmation in St. Mary's on Sunday, or we would have expected you back with Dr. M. I was particularly anxious to consult you about the publication of our manuscript concerning \"the burning of our convent\"-- I told you before, about Genl Hill writing to me for an account of it-- & perhaps the Rector told you of Dr. Trezevants visit requesting [In left hand margin in longhand] All send aff & very grateful respects, beg your prayers & benedictions--especially your own Sister Ellen. Sr. Baptista I am so much gratified that the Rector told you he was pleased with his visit here. Write soon & come if you can conveniently[End Page 1] us to give a statement as to how we got possession of the \"Preston Place\" & saved it--which statement will be published. Today I received a message from professor LeConte of S.C. College, asking for the same. I did the amiable to them all, & unless you will correct & revise our manuscript & have it printed, others will have us in print anyway. Genl Preston offers to print it for us in April, but I cannot accept his offer without your consent & I would be sorry to do anything that would [illegible] against religion or the future interests of our convent. You know that when Abp Purcell gave me such \"a slap in the face\" about Sherman & Hampton, I [illegible][End Page 2] enclosed him the pamphlet \"sack & burning of Columbia\" by Simms. He seems to have been staggered a little by it & sent it on to Capt Cornyn [?] (the commissary who gave us rations & $50 in greenbanks.) for corroboration, he however answers it I think evasively & his letter has been published in the \"Cincinnati Telegraph,\" the Abp's organ-- & is now going the rounds of the papers South I am told. I believe Mr. Cornyn [?] to be a man of undoubted probity & yet his statements are not true. I suppose thro' ignorance. The subject has become so agitated, that a certain set of respectable citizenry will attest to the fact of Columbia having been burned by the army under Sherman-- & our account is[End Page 3] to be a sort of corroborative evidence, together with that of a hundred others. I feel some timidity about this. For Dr. Trezevant, I have had simply my letters to Mrs. Dr. Darby (Miss Mary [illegible] Preston that was)-- & Genrl John L. Preston's letters to me written-- since he only wants to prove, that that house--private property, was ordered to be burned. They are all very warm on the subject just now-- & it is really wonderful to me, that an attestation is required of a thing as plain as that the sun shining--! If you cannot come up to Valle Crucis & go to Cheraw also I suppose I must sacrifice the pleasure of seeing you to our dear Parents--Anna will hardly be able to travel so soon & I should think not for some time. John telegraphs--she is not so well--he cannot be at home before Saturday. You can hear quicker than we from Cheraw. I feel anxious about Anna.[End Page 4]"
