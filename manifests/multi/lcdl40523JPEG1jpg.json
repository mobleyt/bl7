Even in the day at night I cant look at a book-- so here I am to much the foe in the morning with armour not lately proved-- and I fear rust for want of use-- in other words I stand on my general Knowledge of the branches.  May I hit on a luckie place!-- However I look on it as a big recitation only-- what difference does one [illegible] make-- I want you to send up for me on Tuesday-- I will be down certainly on that day.  Do have something good to Eat put by for me-- I have not had any thing worth speaking of for a month--  I went to see Mr Baker the other day he sends his respects to Papa and yourself  Love to all--  Your affectionate Son  Columbia June 1852-- Edward Barnwell  Jas Lowndes is very sick again--"
