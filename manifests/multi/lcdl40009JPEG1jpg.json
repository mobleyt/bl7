      "value": "Savannah, GA, Feb 5th 1840 Rev and Dear Sir, I received your favor of the 29th ult in due time. I must say that it was long and anxiously waited for. But I suppose that circumstances not under your control prevented you from replying sooner to me. I did, it is true, expect more punctuality from you, but perhaps, the want of it on your part has been permitted by God for the purpose of testing my patience. It is not useful, however, to search into his unsearchable ways. When I was in Charleston last November, I called at your house for the purpose of having a personal conversation with you, but I found that you were absent from the city, which was a source of bitter disappointment to me. I then made up my mind to write again to you on my arrival here, but a variety of circumstances not under my control prevented me from doing so, until within a few days, when I wrote a letter which was already sealed, when I rec[raised letter]d yours. You inform me in your communication that you wrote to the Rev. Mr. Neufville regarding me. I am glad that you did so, as I was speaking to him sometime since, and making inquiry as to the preliminary measures I should pursue previous to the solemn step I am about to take. I thought it my duty to do so, especially as I did not receive from you the requisite information as I expected. In my last letter to you I stated that my final decission [sic] would be made on the 15th of March, as that day will be the anniversary of my birth. I will try to be prepared by that time, but I fear that obstacles of which I have some foresight, will prevent my being in Charleston before the first week of April. If these should take place, I trust that it will not make much difference in your estimation. You urge me in your letter to seek guidance and peace from God by diligent and heartfelt prayer. My Dear Sir: I have been seeking both from Him for some years; and I confidently hope that the time is near at hand when the object of my prayers shall be granted; But if I should even still have to suffer mental conflicts, it will be a source of consolation to me [End Page 1] that I acted from the dictates of my conscience. As I am hard pressed for time I must hastily conclude by requesting of you to write soon to me, and to research for me such a line of proceeding as your own best Judgment may suggest. I remain, as usual, with fraternal love and Christian affection your ever devoted friend And servant in Christ John Fielding P.S. It may not, perhaps, be amiss to inform you that, until such time as arrangements may be made for my entering the ministry (If I should be thought worthy of such an honor in your Church) I would have no objection to accept of any situation that would not be incompatible with such pretensions. I feel myself bound to make this suggestion, for tho I do not labor under any pecuniary embarrassment. I am by no means independent and there are few, if any, who would feel more poignantly his being a burthen on others than I would. I will however leave everything to your guidance and direction, flattering myself that you will do every thing that lies in your power for me, and confidently trusting that He to whom the secrets of all hearts are known, may, by the light of his Holy Spirit guide both you & me thro' that straight but narrow path which leads to the enjoyment of everlasting life. J.F. [End Page 2] Letter of Rev. Mr. Fielding Feb. 5th 1840 Ansd March 5th paid <SAVANNAH FEB. 6 GA> Rev. Mr. Barnwell Charleston So.Ca. 87 1/2 87 1/2 87 25 1/2 -------- $287 1/2 [End Page 3]"
