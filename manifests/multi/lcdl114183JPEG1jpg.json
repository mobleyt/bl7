      "value": "Columbus, Ohio\nAugust 10, 1929\n\nMy dear Miss Bragg:\n\n\tIt is about three weeks since I wrote to you when I was at Buffalo. After two days stay there at Buffalo, I went to Meadville, Pennsyvania and spent two days with my teacher. With her I had a nice time. She introduced me to an American lady who was born in China and was very fond of speaking Chinese. So after a few words in English at first we had a nice talk in Chinese. She was the first American I have ever met who could speak very good Chinese.\n\n\tNow I have been more than two weeks here in Columbus, Ohio. Only a few days after I came here, Mr. Li and I planned to travel more. But as the climate here in Columbus is fine and Mr. Wang and several other Chinese [2] friends persuaded me to stay, I did not follow Mr. Li to leave for Detroit but remain here for the rest of my summer vacation.\n\n\tMy life here in Columbus is really enjoyable. Although I planned to read some before I came here, I actually can read very little. Most of my time is occupied in talk with my friends and in sleep. I usually go to bed after ten o'clock and do not get up till it is nearly ten o'clock in the morning the next day.\n\n\tI shall stay here up to September 10 when it is the time for me to leave for Chicago and wait there for my friend. I shall not go to Seattle as I formerly wished, for now I find it is a rather long trip and I do not joy in riding in the train for several days.[3]\n\n\tMr. Li told me that it was very hot when he was in Charleston. I do not know how it is now. Probably you are not in Charleston but in Richmond. No matter where--ever you are. I wish you would write to me, when you have time, and tell me how is your summer.\n\n\tHopeing you are enjoying good health.\n\n\tYours affectionately,\n\n\tFong Lee Wong\n\nP.S. All the pictures I took at Niagara Falls have turned out pretty good. Here I just inclose [sic] two pieces for you. You will see the rest after I return to Charleston.\n\tF.L.W.\n\n[From:] Fong Lee Wong\n181 W. Tenth Ave.\nColumbus, Ohio\n\n[Addressed:] Miss Laura M. Bragg\n38 Chalmers Street\nCharleston, S.C.\nValentine Museum\nRichmond, Va\nEpping, New Hampshire"
