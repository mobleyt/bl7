It is striking in appearance, enclosed by a semi-circular brick wall about twelve feet high and surrounded by iron spikes. Prior to the Revloution it was the home of Col. Miles Brewton, and during that war was occupied as headquarters by Lord Rawdon and Col. Nesbit Balfour, commandant of Charleston; since then it has been in the possession of Bull and Pringle families, and is known as the Bull-Pringle House.\"",
