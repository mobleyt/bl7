October 29 1834 My Dear Friend & Brother, For a considerable time after my fever left me & I was about I found it disrupting to write and this prevented my expressing to you the pleasure your kind & sympathizing letter gave me. This prevented me so long that I got into the way of putting off so that now I am almost ashamed to write. It was, indeed, my expectations to have visited the city before this--and to have talked with you face to face about that goodness of the Lord of which I have had so much experience. O he is indeed [MS ripped] a very present help in my time [MS ripped]. How great is his goodness [hole in MS] is his beauty. To be on the verge [MS ripped] to have become opened before [MS ripped] He as thro' a bright vista the [End Page 1] the glorious temple above--to see laid open to your gaze the very holy of holies and behold Jesus there and the blood washed and white-robed [illegible] bowing in rapturous devotion at his feet & to hear as it was their very voices -- & to feel that you are just going to join them & to bow with them at Jesus' feet & sing with them the praises of Jesus. O my Brother it is a joy unspeakable full of glory & I think I can truly tho' humbly, I need not add thankfully, say that such was in the depths of my sickness, the visions, the joy that the Lord in undeserved goodness & mercy vouchsafed to me and what does such a kind & merciful promise Keeping Savior deserve at our [MS ripped]. Let us live near to him. It is [MS ripped] he wishes--that his hand may set up [MS ripped] what peace--peace over as a [MS ripped].

It is said of him that he could not in a certain place do no marvels because of the peoples' unbelief and how constantly may it be said so in respects of their souls & the miracles of grace which he is ever ready to work within & for them? Lord I believe help those [MS illegible] unbelief. I am happy to hear that the Lord gives you comfort in your Ministry [MS ripped] have laid the corner [stone?] of your church I do trust. Jesus was there & marked it & stamped upon it [illegible] the seal of his approbation. O may it indeed be a church built upon the foundations of apostles & prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [MS ripped] glad to hear that you intend [MS ripped] us soon. I wish you would [hole in MS] to come with you.
