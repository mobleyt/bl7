      "value": "Decr 25\n\nMy Dear Sisters-\nThe letters I wrote you last\nweek must have prepared for the [illegible]\nof my beloved Sister- to me, from my child-\nhood up she had been a Mother Sister, friend\ncounsellor and companion- every thing that a\nwoman of a pure, loving heart could be\nto another- but she is gone and I shall never\nlook upon her like again again- she had\nborne all my burdens in life I shared all\nmy joys generously sympathizing with\nme in all the deep sorrows and joys of life-\nbut I cannot help rejoicing with her\nfor I know it is her everlasting gain and that\nshe will never suffer any more pain for her\nagonies are past- As soon as I realized\nthat in her feeble state, she had taken a dread-\nful cold, I could not hope that even her strong\nconstitution could ever master it, and therefore\ncould not expect to see her recover, but every\nthing was done to save her life that could be\ndone, for dear Stuart did not feel so- he hop'd \non and worked to the very last and even when she\nwas seized with her last attack of shortness of\nbreath last tuesday afternoon he was prepar-\ning to go to Boston to try to get Dr. Munroe \n\n[End page 1]\n\nto come out and see her, but as he could not\nbear to leave her whilst suffering, he staid\nsupposing it would pass off- but it never\ndid until in about 3 hours she was re\nleased by the hand of death and went up\nto join the Church of the first born- For\n2 hours she suffered great agony for want of\nbreath- but this gradually subsided and we\nhardly knew when she breathed her last-\n\nTheodore, myself and Stuart were with her and her\nfaithful nurse but we were all powerless\nto relieve the battle for breath the poor soul\nhad to fight alone- We had mutually\n[illegible] each other to perform the last offic-\nes, and I did putting on my own clothes on\nher and knowing that she had a great many\nfriends round Boston we have put the fu-\nneral off until Saturday- This is the sad-\ndest Christams I ever spent she begged to\nburied in a wooden coffin at no lavish ex-\npense but in great simplicity and at no [illegible]\nnecessary expense- the poor need such\na testimony- funerals are very expensive here\nWe shall purchase a lot in Mt. Hope Ce-\nmetery about 3 miles off- I can write\nno more now but will next week\n\nAffy AGW\n\n[End page 2]"
