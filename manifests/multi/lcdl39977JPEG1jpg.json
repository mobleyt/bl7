Friends?] Charleston-- July 11. 1832 Sickness, my dear [illegible], & an afflicting dispensation in our [family?] together with my [illegible[ [occupations?], have delayed till this late time my [illegible: answering?] [illegible] [last?] letter I rejoice greatly in the spirit which breathes through every [illegible], [&?] cannot hesitate to believe that the feelings you [experience?], are almost of blessings to yourself & the church-- [His?] [illegible] [to?] [illegible] [of?] [illegible] your trust so entirely on our blessed Saviour [looking?] up so simply & sincerely for the aid of his Spirit-- Happy are you Go [on?] as you have begun & the God of grace will be with you strengthening you in the inner [illegible] till you grow up to the [measure?] [illegible] stature of the fullness of christ-- you Know in whom you have believed, & you are sure that unless you [illegible] [illegible[ [illegible] by neglecting his means of grace he will never leave you nor forsake you Truly 'tis a comforting assurance that he is ever ready to forgive all our backslidings, all our coldness, all our want of faith whenever we so but [raise?] [an?] eye [of?] [illegible] [sufflication?] to him-- This alone is my consolation, that even my most [illegible: hole in page/ imperfect?] [illegible] if they be [illegible] & if I am always striving to do better will by the free mercy of Christ be accepted in him As to being saved by anything that we can do who that Knows himself can dream of that!-- Miserable indeed should I be if I had to rely-- I will not say on my fulfilling of the law of God-- but was I to depend on the [illegible] of my faith, the thoroughness [illegible] repentance, the deepness of myself abasement-- for even our [illegible] done in an evangelical spirit Alas how [illegible] are they of sin the wasting of my tears needs to be washed again in the blood [illegible: of?] Saviour\"-- Nay while I write this impassioned as it may [illegible: seem?] [End Page 1] what more can I say than that I desire to feel [illegible: page torn] having any [adequate?] sense of my own [illegible: usefulness?] & [helpless?] [illegible] of the holiness of my Maker & the mercy [illegible: of?] [my?] Saviour & the long suffering of his Spirit, [there?] are [words?] easily in my mouth & some feeling of them may be in [my?] [heart?], but who can realize them!-- Your longing after such a faith as that of Whitfield or [Hooker?] or Luther &c is natural & laudable, for we shared aim at the [illegible]-- but we [illegible] cast down if you cannot attain to it-- As for me I scarcely dare to hope for any such degree [illegible: hole in page. of?] excellence in this world-- the Spirit of the Most High is I Know most powerful. but 'tis not often that he gives such blessings, particularly to those who have worked many years of their lives as I have in forgetfulness of him-- [illegible: bonds?] that I believe he [pours?] out his Spirit in a large measure to few others than those whom he means to make instruments of great power, as Wesley & Whitfield were in reviving piety in England & Luther in cleansing the pollutions [of?] the [church?]-- This I mean, that while we should pray for the largest supplies of grace we should not expect him to give to us as [he?] did to them, though we should always feel that he may so borrow us-- Thus, it seems to me, our desires will be large & our labours abundant, while even the least portion of grace being a favour we shall not be cast down by finding ourselves often cold in our devotions & strangely insensible to what we Know that we ought to feel-- True my friends, our not feeling [illegible: torn page. as?] those Martyrs & Confessors did is want of faith, & we must ever [illegible: torn page] earnestly for more & lament that we have so little-- but [illegible: torn page] not this harass us nor make us restless dissatisfied, for [illegible: torn page] we be feeble still God will receive us if we be sincere in try-- [End Page 2] [illegible: torn page] look up to him for support, & if little is given to us he will not require [a?] disproportionate return-- Not that I [say?] [illegible: faded ink. often?] to [encourage?] [illegible] but only to discourage a gloom which [illegible] have felt at [times?] [illegible] down very heavily upon me as though I were too weak to be of any use in my ministry-- I have [almost?] been in despair, not that I doubted God's [illegible: faded ink. willingness?] to forgive me-- ut I questioned whether I desired [forgiveness?] as I ought & whether I longed for holiness as I should & therefore I doubted whether me whose own state was so uncertain could be of any use to others-- May my sinful distrust be forgiven me-- but I Know that the [illegible: hole in page] are apt to be desponding & therefore I venture to caution you-- When we think [how?] some stirring are the truths of the Gospel we are inclined to [wonder?] that they should even affect us otherwise than most powerfully, engrossing Our whole souls, & governing every thought & [word?] & action-- but then again when we think of the [merits?] of the world, the whisperings of the Arch Enemy, & the foul beast within us, we are amazed that we should ever have any relish for [illegible: hole in page. heavenly?] things-- now take all unto consideration, & we see that as long as we are in the body we must expect the flesh to strive against the Spirit, & we [illegible: hole in page. should?] have reason of coldness & depression, when our lips may move in prayer yet our hearts be wandering & all our pious duties be performed as though they were a task-- Then the struggle is to perform them at all, & I question not that a [perseverance?] in them, notwithstanding that they are so unsatisfactory to us is [more?] acceptable to God than the offerings which we make with glowing hearts, when the very sense of his presence is an encouragement & present reward-- I am satisfied that one's piety is not to be measured by one's feelings-- but by the readiness with which one perseveres in [mortifying?] his evil passions, & bringing every thought under captivity Christ & devoting his whole life to the service of his fellow men for [illegible] sake of his Redeemer-- Then though he be cheered now by the lights the Divine Presence or left to grope his way uncertain of his own [illegible] & without this present comforts of faith, I doubt not that it will be well with [illegible] [End Page 3] even of an interpretation without being obliged often to go to the original, [particularly?] against the Unitarians, who being hard pressed by an English [illegible] try to evade it by the most refined & sophisticated & [minutely?] grammatical [exaggerating?] appeal to their hearts is not enough, for while their heads are fully [surrounded?] that they are right their hears are closed-- So too often Baptists, & indeed of all who suffer from an [Apostolical?] church-- Indeed I cannot satisfy my own conscience unless I am sure from [illegible: hole in page] reference to the Greek & Hebrew that [the?] [explanation?] I am [giving?] rests upon something better than the [illegible] [illegible: authority?] [illegible: of?] our [version?]-- & [their?] controversies, they must [illegible]-- I will send you if I can lay my hands on it, the list of our Studies in the General Seminary & shall be happy to receive for you any of the books you may want-- I am glad to hear of your having passed your first examination, & hope to learn soon that another has been passed, & another, till you be thoroughly [furnished?] & prepared for your great work-- Great indeed is the preparation needed in these [days?] of heresy & [illegible] & all manner of error-- not preparation of the feast merely-- though that we both admit it is the [illegible] of first importance-- but no less essential is the preparation of [the?] [illegible]-- [illegible: torn page]-- not [illegible] an acquaintance with the English Bible [at?] [illegible] [illegible: page torn] examination of the Greek, & if possible the Hebrew [illegible: page torn] necessary-- I find it so every day-- I cannot shew the [written on side of page:] [illegible] is a [precious?] season of leisure for [staying?] your nerves & mind as well as improving your heart-- O Let it not pass away-- Do not [spend?] too much time in teaching [the?] negroes [or?] in any thing that will [illegible: hole in page] [an?] [off?] [from?] your studies-- They are first in their claim upon you-- Believe me your friend & Brother Paul Trapier William H. Barnwell Beaufort South Carolina[End Page 4]"
