      "value": "Charleston June 15th 1837 And now, My Dearest Friend, according to promise so I appear before you to offer my sincerest thanks for your last truly welcome letter--and at the same time to expatiate on the subject you introduced to my notice--Indeed My Friend, I hardly know how to thank you for letters so replete with instruction, knowledge, and interest--Nor can I feel satisfied with my manifestations of gratitude, until I find myself moulding my character and conduct according to your excellent counsel--and thus proving it to have made a lasting impression upon my heart--Indeed, you could not have selected a subject more acceptable to me than the one you chose--viz--The great importance of acquiring a habit of application when engaged either in study or reading--'Tis a habit of neglect of which now occasions me the greatest imaginable inconvenience--yes, I have since a child accustomed myself to a mere mechanized sort of reading--to a seeing with the eye, and a turning of the page, while my mind was busily engaged with thoughts most foreign to the of my optical and manual labours or else while it was in a most inactive state, nor experiencing a single thought on the subject of perusal--Now, this habit has I am aware had a very pernicious effect upon my mental abilities--for, since it allows them to remain unexercised in a[End Page 1] dormant state, must they not like the powers of the body for want of opportunity and development loose their strength, and gradually languish? And in the second place, this habit is an insurmountable barrier to my mental cultivation--for, how is it possible for me to derive advantage from reading, unless application, by fixing my attention upon the subject, calls into practise the different powers of my mind requisite for the investigation and comprehension of the said subject and thus prepares clear and well-arranged thoughts for the reception of the memory, which is indeed \"the keeper of all knowledge\"--But, this, though the greatest & not the only evil to which this habit of inattention subjects me--for, besides impoverishing my mind by withholding all wholsome aliment, it harrasses it, when I engage in study by continually withdrawing it from its subject, by seducing it from the path of duty and leaving it to retrace its steps, unaided by signs or waymarks--It may I think be said to be continually waging war with attention the citadel of the mind--And now, My Friend, that I have been so long subject to this insidious foe, now, that I am acquainted with all its modes of attack, I must make use of clear-bough experience and defend my mental kingdom by gaining sure possession of this habit of application, the invincible fortress of the mind-- Ever your Kind Friend V.
