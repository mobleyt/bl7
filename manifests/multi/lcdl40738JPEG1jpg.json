      "value": "The Missing Bells. We miss the bells with their tones sublime, And the mellow notes of St. Michael s chime, For the Sabbaths come as they came of yore, But the Sabbath bells are heard no more. A stillness reigns o er the city now, And the prayerful throngs in silence bow, When the holy light of the Sabbath morn Is ushered in with a rosy dawn. No music floats on the passing gale, But the missing bells tell a sad, sad tale-- For their strains were lost in the cannon s roar, And the Sabbath bells are bells no more. They muttered loud with a smoky breath, On the battle-filed, mid the scenes of death, The same soft bells that had sounded praise From the steeple tops in our peaceful days. Oh! soon may the solemn silence cease, And the bells re-echo the notes of peace: May our hearts once more with their music thrill, And beat responsive to Love, and Good Will. GRAND CONCERT OF SACRED MUSIC IN AID OF St. Michael s Bells, AT THE CITADEL SQUARE CHURCH, MONDAY EVENING, MARCH 18, 1867. THE CHOIR WITH BE ASSISTED BY MR. T. D. BUDDOCK, And several Ladies and Gentlemen, comprising some of the best Musical Talent in the city, who have kindly tendered their services. THEO D. BUDDOCK, ORGANIST. GEO. O. ROBINSON, CONDUCTOR. Doors open at Halfpast Seven. Concert to commence at Eight o clock. JOS. WALKER, AGT., PRINTER, CHARLESTON, S.C.[End Page 1] PROGRAMME. 1. ORGAN-- Introductory, SPHOR. 2. GRAND CHORUS, RIGHINI. The Lord is great and greatly to be praised. Who shall not fear Him and glorify His name? All the nations shall come and worship Him and glorify His name. Who shall not fear Him? Blessed are the people that know the joyful sound. They shall ever walk in the light of His countenance; and in His name shall they rejoice, and in His righteousness shall be exalted. He is their glory and their strength, and in His name shall they rejoice. 3. TRIO-- Oratorio Creation, HAYDN. On Thee each living soul awaits; from Thee, O Lord, all see their food. Thou openest thy hand and all are filled with good. But when Thy face, O Lord, is hid, with sudden terror they are struck. Thou tak st their breath away, they vanish into dust. Thou sendest forth thy breath again, and life with vigor fresh returns: revived earth unfolds new strength and new delights. 4. DUO-- Oratorio Creation, HAYDN. Graceful consort at thy side softly fly the golden hours; every moment brings new rapture; every car is lulled to rest. Spouse adored, at thy side purest joys o erflow the heart; life and all I have is thine-- my reward thy love shall be. The dew-dropping morn, O how it quickens all! The coolness of even, O how it all restores! How grateful is of fruits the savor sweet! How pleasing is of fragrant bloom the smell! But, without thee, what is to me the morning dew, the breath of even, the sav ry fruit, the fragrant bloom? With thee is every joy enhanced, with thee, delight is ever new, with thee, is life incessant bliss. Thine, thine it all shall be. 5. CHORUS-- The Heavens are Telling, -- Creation HAYDN. The Heavens are telling the glory of God. The wonder of His work displays the firmament. To-day that is coming, speaks it the day; the night that is gone to following night. The Heavens are telling the glory of God; the wonder of His work displays the firmament. In all the lands resounds the word; never unperceived, ever understood. The heavens are telling the glory of God, the wonder of His work displays the firmament. 6. ORGAN-- Concerto, 7. CHORUS AND SOLO-- Kyrie (3d Mass) HAYDN. 8. SOLO AND CHORUS-- Qui Tollis (3d Mass) HAYDN. 9. SOLO AND CHORUS-- Quoniam (3d Mass) HAYDN. 10. RECITATIVE AND ARIA-- On Mighty Pens --Oratorio Creation HAYDN. RECITATIVE. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl, that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. ARIA. On mighty pens uplifted soars the Eagle aloft, and cleaves the air in swiftest flight to the blazing sun. His welcome bids to morn the merry lark: and cooing calls the tender dove his mate. From every bush and grove resound the nightingale s delightful notes. No grief affected yet her breast, nor to a mournful tale were tuned her soft enchanting lays. 11. GRAND CHORUS-- Oratorio Messiah, HANDEL. Hallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. The kingdom of this world is become the kingdom of out Lord and of His Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! [End Page 2]"
