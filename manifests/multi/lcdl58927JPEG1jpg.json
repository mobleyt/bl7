      "value": "Carolina ART  Association  MINUTES OF CIVIC SERVICES COMITTEE MEETING  -  February 6, 1946   The Civic Services Committee of the Carolina Art  Association met at the Gibbes Art Gallery at 5 o\" cock on Wednesday, February 6, 1946, Mr. place, Chairman, presiding. Those present incuded: Messrs. Krawcheck, Rogers , Staats, Stoney, Chamberain, Cuer, Atman, Aison, Burton, Waton; Miss Alice Huger Smith, Miss Helen Breeand and Mrs. Harry M. Rubin; Mr. Whitelaw, director of the Carolina Art Associaltion.   Mr. Whitelaw requested Mr. Staats to outine briefy the plan for a sketch of Charleston revealing the need for changes in its physical plan.   Mr E. Miby Burton was wecomed to the committee after an absence of three and a haf years in the Navy.   Mr. Whitelaw reported that last year t.he Committee had tried to made an analysis of the organizations in Charleston with the view of cooperating with the Charleston welfare Counci. Work on this was discontinued, however, because of the resignation of the staff member who was handing it . It is hoped the Committee can continue this program soon.   Kenneth Chorey\"s recommendation for a Foundation for Charleston was brought up for discussion with each member present being given an opportunity to express an opinion. It is the general feeling that such a Foundation would be a valuable asset to Charleston but that work on it must begin in Charleston then expland to those interested persons outside of this community.   Mr . Altman reported the special committee appointed by City Council to investigate the Off-Street Parking plan is now working on an estimate of costs and is trying to determine whether the and needed would be avaiable through sae. He stated that on the surface it appears, because of ega technicaities, that final consumation of the plan would e a ong drawn out affair. In response to a suggestion from Mr. Krawcheck that if parking were removed from King street entirey beow Calhoun other business firms would open up off-street parking areas as private business ventures, Altman stated the city is now planning to mark off the west side of King st. in individual parking spaces which will aow open space between cars . He caed attention to the difficuties invoved in the King st. traffic probem. Mr. Whitelaw added that the traffic problem on King st. cannot be soved by the remova of parking since it is due to the flow of traffic. He added he has recenty visited twenty-three cities in the United States, a of which have serious traffic proems but none of which has a plan as far advanced as that of the Off-Street Parking plan submitted to City Council by our Committee. Hr. Stoney suggested the time has come for the Civic Services to divorce itself from the problem of traffic in King Street, since the\n\n[End Page 1]\nMinutes of Civic Services Committee Meeting February 6, 1946   Committee has given a working plan to the city and now future action is up to the city itself and the merchants of Charleston. The Committee was in fu agreement with Mr. Stoney\"s suggestion and offered any assistance to the city that it can give.   It was agreed the Committee should begin to work on a broader city plan for Charleston and on the plans for setting up a Foundation as recommended by Mr. Chorey. The Chairman was requested to select a committee to study the possibiities of such a Foundation and to make recommendations to the Civic Services Committee for a workable plan. Mr. Whitelaw caed attention to the action taken by the merchants on King Street between Hase and Wentworth or improvement of the appearance of this section. It was moved by Mr . Krawcheck, seconded by Mr. Waton, that a letter be sent to Mr. E. H. Pounot, Jr., Chairman of the merchant\"s Committee, commending the group on their action.   There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at 5:55 pmo   Respectfuy submitted,   Mrs . Harry M. Rubin, Acting Secretary\n\n[End Page 2]"
