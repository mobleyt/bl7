      "value": "Reverend Robert Woodward Barnwell Professor Robert Woodward Barnwell was born in Beaufort South Carolina on May 23rd 1831. He was the son of the Rev. William H. Barnwell and Catharine Osborne Barnwell and nephew of President Robert Woodward Barnwell. Beginning his education under Mr. Cotes of Charleston and Rev. Stiles Mellichamp, principal of St. Peters's Parochial School, he entered the sophomore class of the South Carolina College in 1847 and was graduated with the second honor in 1850. He commenced the study of law in that year, but in April 1851 was entered as a candidate for orders in the Diocese of South Carolina. In 1854 he visited Europe, devoting himself to Hebrew and theology, acquiring a very thorough knowledge of German, which he spoke fluently, and of French, and leaving a reputation for scholarship among his professors as high as that of any American student of his day. He travelled through Italy, Switzerland, Holland, England and France, and returning to Carolina was ordained deacon in 1856. His first charge was at Zion Richland District South Carolina, but on Sept. 17th 1857, he was elected to the chair of Moral Philosophy and Sacred Literature in the South Carolina College. While professor at this college, he declined the presidency of William and Mary College Virginia, and rectorship of Trinity Church, Washington, D. C. He married in June 23d 1858 Mary Carter Singleton. In 1861, he went to Virginia and organized an aid association consisting of gentlemen from Carolina, for the purpose of establishing, supplying and attending hospitals for the sick and wounded of the South Carolina troops in the Confederate armies in Virginia. The headquarters of these hospitals were at Char-[End Page 1] lottesville, but the association extended its aid to many other places where our troop were stationed. In the prosecution and extension of this arduous work, he continued until his death on June 23rd 1863. It may safely be said that few more brilliant and gifted Alumni than Robert Woodward Barnwell have ever been graduated from the college. A scholar from boyhood, his capacity for intellectual work was only equalled by the ease and rapidity with which he acquired knowledge. As professor in the lecture room and as a preacher in the pulpit, he possessed powers of imparting knowledge, of stimulating to mental effort and of persuasion to a religious seldom excelled. An orator by temperament and inheritance, trained in rationalization by Thornwell and in grace and diction by Preston, and enlightened by the profound and comprehensive learning of Germany, while his language glowed with imagination, his reasoning was that of the thinker and scholar. He wrote almost as easily as he spoke. His talent for organization was shown in every department that came under his care. His zeal and enthusiasm for whatever he undertook triumphed over all doubts and difficulties. His short life of thirty-two years was spent for the most part in labor for the generation now passing away, which knew and admired and loved him, and in devotion to the sick and suffering soldiers in the camps and on the battlefield and in the hospitals of the armies in Virginia. In their behalf he exhausted his strength and finally laid down his life as truly a hero of that terrible war as though he had died upon the field of battle.[End Page 2]"
