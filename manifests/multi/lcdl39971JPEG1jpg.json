      "value": "Litchfield June 21st 1826 Dear Hetty As soon as you receive this, you must set yourself down to the deliberation and settlement of a serious question, viz whether it will be more conducive to your convenience and pleasure, to receive through the summer, a series of long-winded scolds, or an agreable succession of amusing good-natured well written letters. If you have, as I doubt not, the same antipathy to a written scold which (I think) I have seen you [evince?] at the delivery of an oral one; hard the talk, you must resume your long neglected pen, you must work up your ideas to the writing \"point\"; and make the upper drawer of your Work Table as useful as the lower-- For, once for all, write I will: and if you do not answer me, scold I shall-- But if on the other hand you should answer my letters, what will I not put into requisition to encourage and amuse you-- History! I will write you an account of the whole history of Connecticut, of the time when witches were the majority of inhabitants of this romantic land, when a visit from Old Nick was as common as the calling of a neighbour, when butter was turned into lamp oil. and cheese into Brimstone, by the malice-- of these broomstick riding gentry-Law! I can't yet go very deeply into this subject, either to fish up amusement or improvement, but I can inform you thus far-- that the Blue Laws are no longer valid in Connecticut, and that a man is now allowed by law to kiss his wife on Sunday as well as another day, and that. Beer. also, or Cider, or any other liquor, has full privilege to work upon the Sabbath, without endangering its owner and Instigator to imprisonment or fine--[End Page 1] Or will you be pleased to taste of some delicate tib bits of Scandal? Here, even here, though a stranger and therefore ignorant of the private histories of persons I can accomodate you. I assure you I have some very fine historical outlines which with a very few finishing touches might be filled out into exceedingly interesting pictures-- Answer my letter-- and at an instant's warning I will brush them and vanish them ready for you pleasure-- Or will you be desirous of drinking rich draughts of Poesy? You must know that an endless resevoir stands at your service-- whence you may assuage your thirst with either the overflowing \"[pintstout?]\" or with the more refined \"Glasses sparkling\". And who knows, (now that we are on my hobby Poetry) but what I may fall in love with, one of these fair witches of Connecticut, and overrun you \"with woeful ballads to my ladies eyebrowï¿½. I must inform you that in this same village of Litchfield there are ladies whose charms would give lustre to the strings of nobler lyres than my poor fingers can ever aspire to strike; \"Earth treading stars such as make darkness bright\"-- Oh! that vile phrase, \"Earth treading\", how came I to use it? it reminds me of one defect in the otherwise perfect [form?] it reminds me, that these Connecticut ladies have unfortunately, most unwieldy feet and \"untapering\" [ancles?], and may therefore be truly called \"earth treading\"-- But as I was going to say, all these things will I attempt, to amuse you if you will but write to me,-- And where too is the difficulty? You Know that any thing however unimportant in itself, must be precious to me, coming from Beaufort-- Besides how can you want materials-- Give me an account of one of your tea parties. [End Page 2] Relate to me all the flirtations, counterflirtations and demiflirtations with all their train of \"walkings\" \"talkings\" \"blushings\" \"dancings\" \"helpings\" and \"ridings\". Tell me what reports such a gentleman having been seen to walk in such a direction, and another gentleman having leaned over another ladies chair, has occasioned,-- what alterations and revolutions, such a gentleman daring the pigeon wing more empahtically, of the Sapnish dance more languishingly with such a p[partner?] may have created in Cousin Sallys marriage Scheme-- Or to descend to particulars,-- Tell me whether the pair of Beaufort Lovers-- the Port Royal \"Hero and Leander\"-- still continue to delight the town by the most interesting picture of refined attachment, and romantic esteems by the most delicately respectful attentions on one hand and the most becomingly modest [illegible: accept?] the other-- And tell me too has Middleton [has?] [he?] learnt to talk? or are his words still \"like angels visits short and far between\"? If he as not learnt \"braw caplain\"-- \"[Bowing?] ones love\" is a weak resistance against a \"weel stockit farm\". And Stephen too our Parish Candidate for Matrimony how goes on his election? Will he go to the Poll with a small party or with a plumper? Well though I should be sorry to lose the aid of one who as my [yokefellow?] \"growned and sweated\" \"under the weary burden\" of beauxship-- still if he desirous of changing his burden I wish him success and would advise him to choose the least of many evils. And Charlotte how comes on her Royal George== her \"Magnus Apollo\"? has he been induced to [End Page 3] change the object of his passion, from masonry to woman? and has he given any signs of courtship? I expect not. such weighty bodies are not easily moved. And now that I have written out my paper my pen and my light (for it is 12 oclock) I must stop-- hoping that you will be induced by this to write to yours-- W Barnwell P.S. Why has not sister B or N written to me. I wrote to the former in N York and the latter, here and as yet have heard not a word-- I hope they dont intend paying me in my own coin for the debt of letters which I owed them in my Senior Year at Cambridge-- WB-- [End Page 4]"
