      "value": "Madame Lynch JMJ Ursuline Convent Nov 17th/58 My Dearest Brother These few collarets made so hastily that I have not leisure? to mask them, are at present all we have to send as a little testimony of gratitude for all your kindness & solitude on our account. When we get rich & have more sisters we will do better- this only to gratify ourselves & to let you see we do not forget you. I will write to Mr Bernard? Phila soon. We recd a letter from a young lady in the West who wishes to join us & requested an immediately reply. We know her very well & by the advice of our sisters I proceed? on your permission & have accepted her - I trust you will approve of what I have done. One of our Laysisters is unable to work at present - & Sr Rose is suffering a little too - I am sorry to see that the Prioress of Carmelite Convent [End Page 1] has resigned her charge - I wrote to her last night. Srs Ursula and Augusta are as well as usual & hoped you would return from Cheraw thru' Columbia but Revd J OConnell told us you intended returning to Charleston soon theefore I scarcely expected you. We want to have a procession on Sunday & wish you were here. We will have day scholars and all. I have not time to say anything more unless to enquire for our dear Mother & Father & why Francis did not come to the Fair. I feel anxious & hope that sickness did not prevent_. My respects to Revd Dr Corcoran & friends of our Commty. Revd Father Oconnell has kindly offered to be the bearer of this to you or I would wait longer & write more legibly. I like him very much as a confessor, & trust our lord will illegible him in the spirits which he now manifests. Recommending myself & Sisters to your fervent prayers & sacrifices My dearest Brother I remain your own Sister Ellen M B Sup [End Page 2]"
