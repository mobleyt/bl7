      "value": "In the Office\nNo .9\nnew address. Sept 29th '42\n2729 Dunbarton Ave\nDear Sidney,\nI got your letter No. 9 to-day dated\nSept 25th - That's pretty good too.\nI was so excited talking to you for\nthree minutes on the telephone I could n't say\nanything. We must do it again and next\ntime I will arrange in advance to talk 6\nminutes instead of three. Everything\nhas to be planned in advance - I was\ntold I could not say how many letter I\nhad received. The weather could not be\nmentioned or any thing to do with boats\n[and] military matters. As a matter\nof fact I had received your letter no 8-\nwhen I talked to you. My it was \nwonderful hearing your voice - It made \nyou seem near even though you are\n6000 miles away-\nIn this morning's letter you\nmention ...\"flying and say \"this has been \nthe most importent part of our work\"......\nthe result is we pick up our mail [and] look\nemmediately for one of these big long envelopes.\"\n[End Page 1]\n2\nHow can you be connected with air?.\nHave you been trying to change over\nto Lester's outfit or what? -\nDo you mean you might go off on\na carrier? - [illegible] I thought you\nwere booked for Hawaii not the\n\"Swanee\" -  what is the dope - Do tell\nme. To think of you on a carrier\nwill be the end- three of you\nat sea is unbelievable-\nDo please tell me your plans Sidney\nI do want to know what is going to \nhappen [and] what to expect. I really\nthink those carriers are nothing but \ndeath traps - targets -  to be sunk.\nThey are god awful!! Can't you\nstay at Pearl Harbor or what? -\nIf you are all of a sudden ordered \nto move please please put in a \nlong distance call for me [and] talk\nto me before you go - Don't forget\nplease do this. I shall call\nyou again a week from this Sunday--\nSunday the 11th I think it is. Was that\na good hour to call? - Please let me know\n[End Page 2]\n3\nalso give me the hotel telephone number.\nHow I would love to be [illegible] you on\nthe beach with those waving palm\ntrees [and] a big orange moon, a ginger\nley and the soft sound of Hawaiian\nmusic. It makes me sick [and]\nmy stomach sort of caves in when\nI think how agonizing it is to\nbe apart. At night when I \ncome home from work it's really \nhell- I first nearly die- thinking\nabout you till morning--\nThe days slip by because I'm\nbusy so much - but the nights\n- god how I would love to be\nwith you - hug you [and] kiss you\n[and] tell you how much I love you.\nMiss Charlotte was wonderful!\nLandine [and] Melle. are all fixed\nup at the Alumnae house in a \nbed room [and] sitting room- for $60- per\nweek with meals. Cheap I think.\nMelle may teach french at the Public\nSchool in Middleburg.\nWe all lunched with Miss C. [and] she told us\n[End Page 3]\n4\nall about the WAAC's - she had been\nout to Des Moine [and] had all the dope-\nFoxcroft is \"the Baby WAAC's\" - they\nare all military - have a Col. Butler\ntraining them and are going to graduate\nas officer material for the WAAC's - which\nis a slick idea. She is always a jump\na head of every body, and she would be\nthe first to have a girls military school.\nI think its tops. It will make them all\ndisciplined to a tea - do them good, [and]\nturn them into good war material for\nofficers in either WAACs or WAVEs -\nMiss Charlotte was most upraised with\nthe whole set up out there. Found it really\nimpressive. The Colored Regiment has seperate\nbarracks, seperate mens etc. it works\nperfectly.\nI dined with Miss C. [and] the Senior Class\nwho arrived a day early to get the idea\nof \"Baby WAACs\" [and] it was great fun-\nThree of the girls lived on ranches in the west\n-- New Mexico, Wyoming [and] Idaho - My\nthey were mad about it! Said it was\nmarvelous! Such air, such country!!!\nSuch scenery!! - Hundreds of acres [and]\nhundreds of head of cattle. They looked\nfull of health too.\n[End Page 4]\n5\nI spent the night [and] motored back to the\noffice at 7.30 A.M. I drove slowly\n[and] it took just 1 1 2 hours - about\n5 gallons of of gas. I am going to\ntry and do it often. It's a swell thing\nto do from so many angles.\nI move into Helen's house on Dunbarton\nAve. for the month of October - then\n1528 31st St. Nov. 1st - for a\nyear.\nBo arrives here Monday the 4th of Oct.\nI have secured \"Lucy\" who waited on the table\nfor us at Seal Harbor - to come for the\nwinter at $100 -- per month to do\neverything -  cook, clean, wait etc. She\n[and] Rose will be happy to gether [and] I think\nit will work out much better than\ngetting blacks who never stay.\nHenry Lowndes tells me our place is\nover run with poachers - He is attempting\nto hawl in a bunch this week.\nI hope I shall get down for a week end [and]\nsee what goes on on the Plantations.\nThe weather is chilly [and] even cold now. It's\nheaven-!!. Summer seems to be really over.\n[End Page 5]\n6\nWhat bothers me thought is the steam heat. It's\nalready been turned on in the building.\nThe first chilly day the little secretaries\nall complained, said they had colds [and] were\ncold -  it's awful. I have the radiator\nturned off in my office [and] the window\nopen but when I go out to lunch\nthe window is closed [and] the heat emmediately\nturned on- It's maddening. Those \ntwo little secretaries of mine never\ntake a strove of ex ercise - no circulation\nthey are fat, soft [and] unhealthy--\nHope I don't look like that when I\nget through a year of this.\nI walk down [and] back or bycicle - but it's\nsuch a short way - I do ex ercises in\nmy room but I don't know how much\ngood they do--\nHappy Birthday to fat face! I am not\ngoing to cable because he would get it after\nthe war--\nLots [and] lots of love my darling--\n[and] keep on writing all the new, everything\nyou do - all details - I love it -\nGertie\n[End Page 6]\nP.S. \nWhat I don't understand is what sort\nof a job you have - besides being\ndesk movers - are you Big Shots?\nAre you directly [illegible] to the\nGeneral Staff? Are you right \nunder Nimitz? - you sound\nimportent - but I do hope\nyou don't get into sea duty\n[and] real danger- of course you\nknow best what you want\nto do - but - god I do hope\nfor the best. If your job it\ninteresting - I am so glad for you-\nyou said it was [and] I am wondering\nwhy you wish to think of \ndoing something else - or is\nall this air idea unavoidable.\nYou say Morris is so efficient. How about\nyourself. I bet you do all the work-\nDo go to the Ostiopath about your\nback. Moving desks doesn't help\t\tS.S.!\nit I assume. Take care of yourself my darling\nHow are your feet [and] your ears?\n[End Page 7]"
