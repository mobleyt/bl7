      "value": "[Page One]\nFort Hill\n2nd May 1845\nMy dear sir,\nIn answer to your first enquiry, \nas to the prohibiting of a war with England and others\nis, one or both, I am of the opinion, there is \nbut little danger of one with the latter, when\nshe should be backed by the former; and that \nis not probable, unless England should con-\nclude, that a rupture between us and her is \nprobable from the Oregon questions. I am \nof the impression, that all danger of hostility\nis from that question. Indeed, I was so strong[?] in-\nproped[?] with that opinion that I deemed it\nmy duty to give Mr. Polk and Mr. Buchanan, \na full statement of the state of the negotiations; \nmy impression of the mode in which the nego-\ntiation ought to be conducted, in order to avoid\nhostilities, and effect, at the same time, can [illegible]; \nand the great danger of being involved in hostil-\nities with England and of losing the [illegible], unless\nthe questions should be managed with \ngreat delicacy[?], combined with great finess\n[Page Two]\nand address. I also stated my opinion, that the quiet and even\ncareful termination of the Zenian[?] question depended \nmuch on the Oregon; that England had no ground\non which she could stand to come to a negative\nwith us, in reference to the former, and that if she \nintended to give us any trouble about it, she \nwould make Oregon the pretense, unless it was \nso mingled as to preach it. I, in addition, \nemphatically stated, that the joint occupancy[?] \nwas the key of the Oregon question; think if we \nheld on to it and conducted the questions, as it ought \nto be, it was hardly possible we could fail; \nbut, if we decided, it would be very difficult \nto avoid hostilities and the Cap [captain] of the territory. I acted\non that belief throughout, and it was owing to \nmy efforts and influence, that the solution to re-\ncede did not pass in the last [illegible].\nMy conversation[?] with Mr. Polk [took place] on my first in-\nterview with him, and long before his inaugural \nwas prepared, as I suffered. It was intended \nto guard him. When I saw it, and saw how daring\nhe had gone against my views, I said at once \nto some of his friends, that I much regretted it, \nand that the course he had taken, would \n[Page Three]\ngive such trouble; endanger the peace of the country, \nand, not improbably, the loss of the Treaty[?].\nYou will see from all this, that, I think, there\nis much danger. Mr. Polk, Mr. Buchanan, Mr. \nWalker and Mr. Johnson are openly committed to \nthe party of receding the joint occupancy, and [today?]\nstopping of the Treaty[?]. If that is done, hostilities \nare inevitable. I fear they will neither have\nthe patriotism nor makings to change their grounds[?]\nand, if that should be so, every thing will depend on\nthe Senate and the South to arrest so mad a conman. \nI call it mad, for it is something worse than \nfolly. If they do their [duty?], [peace?] may still be \n[present?]. England does not desire war. On \nthe contrary, she [dreads?] its efforts, and wishes for \npeace. I cannot but think, it will yet be [needed?], \nbut there is much danger. \nThe probability is, that there will be much agi-\ntation of the question of peace or war at the next\n[Zenian?], by the administration should intrest\nand settle the [Oregon] question by being the boundary between the [two]\ncounties in the way. The difficulty of doing that has \nbeen much increased by the greater intrest on \nthe inaugural and the late debate in Parliament; \nwhich may still be done, I think, if Mr. \n[Page Four]\nBuchanan should have the venue to settle in. I believe\nhim to be inclined to do so, but I doubt his [friendship?]. \nAs to the efforts of the war, if it should occur, \nI cannot doubt, but it will be [calamitous?] to \nboth countries, and especially so to our banking\ninstitutions. It would be difficult for them \nto avoid [suspicion?] either South or North.\nFor now have my opinion. I do not intend \nit for the publick, but have no [objection?] to it \nbeing made known to such friends, or you may\nthink proper, and in chore [direction?] you can \n[illegible]. \nYours truly\nJ.[John] C.[Caldwell] Calhoun\nH.[Henry] W.[Workman] Conner Sr."
