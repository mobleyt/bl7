There is no intention to exclude ladies Yours Most respectfully & truly in Christian love Edward McGrady Resolved. That in consideration of the undertaking of St Peters Congregation to support the Rev. Mr Boone in China, we do not feel at liberty to call upon its members for contributions to the Mission now proposed, but that on the contrary many of us here present would cheerfully recognize their right to call on us for aid, if such aid be requisite at any time for the maintenance of that Mission [End Page 1] The Rev. Mr Miles having offered himself to the Foreign Committee of our Board of Missions, as a Missionary to Mesopotamia & having been accepted by them upon condition that the necessary funds could be raised in this Diocese, a Meeting for the purpose of consultation upon the practicability expediency and best mode of accomplishing that object, is to be held at St. Stephens Chapel Tomorrow Afternoon at 5 OClock The Male members of this Congregation are earnestly invited to give their attendance at that meeting Sunday 9 April 1843 [End Page 2] Rev.
