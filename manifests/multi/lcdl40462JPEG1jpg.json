      "value": "Savannah Ga November 10th 1870 Dear Mamma I have been trying to write you a letter for three days but have been as you see unable to accomplish it I have written letters to several parties and cant rember what I have written home so excuse all reppetition. You have heard that I am with Mess Jno [H?] Gardner & Co at salary of fifty dollars per month of this I have apportioned thirty five for living expenses. Out of which I pay for room rent $6 66 1/3 for dinner $15 00-- & for washing 3.50 leaving for Breakfast & Supper $10 00/100-- I stay at Dr Billy Elliots with the two Heywards & Every thing is very nice & every attention paid us. I dine at a french [Restaurant?] have very good living & for breakfast take a cup of coffee etc at another restaurant I take no tea-- Go to the office at a little after seven & except a short hour for dinner remain until nine at night-- Mr Gardner, the Senior Partner [written on left-hand side of page:] I must close now for I cant spare much time work is at present my chief object-- & with [Gods?] grace I will pursue it with all diligence I have a great deal to improve & intend to improve all if I can with all love to you & all my darling mother I am Your son Allard[End Page 1] is a very pleasant man but I dont have much to do with him Mr Knapp the Jr Partner is also a very pleasant man & has the reputation of being the most particular & strictest of business men the very folding of a paper is of dire importance to him. Yesterday I was sent about 135 miles on the Atlantic & Gulf R.R. to see after some lumber started at 4oc with the prospects of being landed four miles from the Mill in the dead of night but persuaded the conductor to check speed as he passed the mill & jumped off so instead of waiting 24 hours for another train took the down train an hour or so later & surprised them by making my appearance at the office this morning. Nina writes cheerfully enough under the circumstances says she dare hardly let her self think of the long separation. I am confident I will be able to support her in Savannah but trust all to God[End Page 2]"
