Serv.t [Most Obedient humble Servant]\nDanl [Daniel] Morgan\nHis Excellency\nBenjn. [Benjamin] Harrison\n[End Page 2]\n[Endorsed:]  General Morgans\nLtre\nDecember 11, 1781\n[End Page 3]\n[Addressed:]     \t\t[On public Service]\nHis Excellency\nBenjamin Harrison\nGovernor of\nfavoured by\t\t\tVirginia\nMr. Brown]\n[seal]\n[End Page 4]"
