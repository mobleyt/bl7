That this defendant and his firm have been for near twenty years sellers of that brand of ale and have sold great quantities of the same in the State of South Carolina. That the object and intent of the said conspirators is to prevent any further sale of the same and thereby put an end to this business of this deponent and his said firm therein, and thereby to enjoin and impoverish the trade and property of this deponent and his said firm and of the said Tracy and Russell. That in furtherance and prosecution of their said unlawful and corrupt conspiracy and combination the said aforenamed conspirators have heretofore at sundry times and especially on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, days of March inst. avowed and declared that they had so unlawfully combined and conspired for the purpose aforesaid and did as the said times together openly threaten and intimidate by threats of injury and harm in their business parties who have heretofore purchased said ale from this deponent's said firm and in particular did so threaten and intimidate and attempt to intimidate Tiedeman\n[End Page 1]\nH.
