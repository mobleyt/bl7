  "description": "Four aerial views of Charleston looking across the peninsula.  Top left: Looking northeast, possibly from St. Michael’s Church, showing Broad Street and the area to its north bounded by East Bay Street, and possibly Queen Street. Cars are parked along the street. Landmarks include the Confederate Home and its rear dormitory apartments, People's Building, Old Exchange Building, and the corner of Broad and Church Streets showing the Bank of South Carolina Building (50 Broad Street) before it was restored. A faint view of the U.S. Customhouse is at the far left. Top right: Looking southeast, possibly from the Francis Marion Hotel, with Meeting Street bisecting the view at a diagonal. Landmarks include the U.S. Customhouse, Charleston Hotel, People’s Building, and St. Philip’s Church. Bottom left: Looking south on King Street, possibly from the Francis Marion Hotel, showing King Street from approximately 360 King down to the bend near Market Street, and the view east of King Street. Vehicles can be seen on King Street. Landmarks include the Masonic Temple Building (270 King Street), the tower of the Peoples First National Bank Building (also known as the Hirsh Israel Building, 275 King Street), and the Hotel Calhoun (238-242 King Street).  Bottom right: Looking southwest, possibly from St. Michael’s Church, toward James Island. Landmarks include the Fort Sumter House (1 King Street), Col. John Ashe House (32 South Battery), rear of First Scots Presbyterian Church (57 Meeting Street), Miles Brewton House (27 King Street), and the north elevation of the John E. Poyas House (69 Meeting Street).",
