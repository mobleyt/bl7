      "value": "Miss. M. Elizabeth Keith Care Dr. O.R.Broyles Jr. Anderson S.C.[End Page 1] Charleston, SC, Sept. 3 1872 Dear Maddie, Your letter of the 29th Ult. came duly to hand and to show you that I fully appreciated you praiseworthy effort, I intended answering it by Monday evening's mail, but having focused that impossible to accomplish with other things demanding my attention, you now behold me Tuesday evening and the post of duty and I should also add of pleasure, for I am always pleased to be able to pay what I owe. So you are again and for the remainder of your visit \"up in town enjoying(?) a surfeit of fruit, for your sakes,\" of course, I might sing \"Would I were with you\" and for my own I'd wish it-- I am glad to hear that you all enjoyed the papers sent for it afforded me great pleasure to mail them tell Ella that my only apology for sending these Landmark Book, is, that knowing the lively interest she used to take in my Masonic affairs I thought she might like to see exactly what the Lodge is-- Trap arrived on Saturday evening and took tea with us, he is looking well after he sojourn in the country-- of course we talked for hours until he got sleepy in fact, when he departed homewards leaving us thoroughly posted in the doings at both the country homes-- Mim's letter to Anna[End Page 2] reached us to day, also one from Mother for Trap and one for Anna from John-- the former on I should say the first was full of news and lightly appreciated, the 2nd I haven't seen and the last informed us that Willis' servants were in the dumps about something or other, had threatened to and would probably leave and Jno. said that if they did that Mother would write you not to stop at K. I merely give this as an item of news which of course you will pay no attention to unless you hear more about it-- You ask for news of \"the happiest man in the world\" but I am sorry to write that he head seems turned by excessive joy, for we hear scarcely a word from him-- Listen M's last letter mentioned that cousin Lizzie White and Dr. H. had returned from Europe and arrived at Cape Elizabeth, where they were all leaving a charming time; that most of the party including F and R.M. were out on a fishing frolic, no wonder he cannot write! Maria went to see Anna to day at lunch time and as I happened to stop in at that hour went part of the way home with her-- C. & S. were on the train last night ready to start for Spartanburg, when they informed me at the ticket office that they were no longer selling Excursion Tickets, as they [illegible] would not take the responsibility of disobeying the advertisements which says until 1st Sept. notwithstanding my telling him that I could arrange it with Col. Pickens and as they did not wish to pay full fare without an effort to arrange it otherwise, they went home again and this morning I succeeded in getting the desired tickets, so they will leave Charleston by the same mail train that this letter will go by-- Tell Mim that this beat her case altogether, her trunk was only packed and in the entry last year but on this occasion the trunk were checked. I am glad to hear from one of your letters that Ella is looking fat and well (I wish I could see her) give her much love and tell her that she is really engaged in a labour of love. I mean to say that she really seems to love the labours of a country life no that's not it either but the mail will close, and I am in such a hurry that I will leave to tell you what I mean to say about Lives later lost (have you ever read it?) when I see you. Good night. Love to all except Bob Broyles Your affect. Bro., Aleck[End Page 3]"
