      "value": "Charleston,\n16 June, 1830\n\nRevd. and Dear Sir,\n\nI received a good while since your letter of 19th\nApril, and certainly owe you an apology for that long delay\nof my answer. I presume you have a Copy of the questions [illegible]\nWed in the Circular in the order in which they appear in\nyour previous letter. I have therefore numbered them, and my\nanswers will bear corresponding numbers.\n1.2.3.4. If imprisonment—for debt it to form a [paeltry?] the ordi:\nnary permanent-scheme of laws, as it now does, there ought o\nbe a limit-: and I know now so appropriate, as to deny to the\nCreditor this privilege of imprisonment, under twenty-Dolls\nthat being the Sum fixed by the Constitution of the W.D. as\nthe limit above which a Citizen Cannot be deprived of trial\nby Jury.\n5.6. I do not think imprisonment for debt ought ever to be al-\nlowed, in any Case after judgment, except on an affixable by\nthe less, or someone for him, of actual fraud or Concealment,\nor of reason to believe it: nor would I suffer the [illegible]\nto have his Execution without giving the Defendant an oppor-\ntunity to answer or oath, subject to a personal examination\nunless the Perp or some one for him would swear that he knew\nor believed the Defendant would conceal himself or abscond,\nor was then about to depart.\n\n[End page 1]\n\n7. I see no use in imprisonment at all under Ca Sa, unless fraud be al-\nleged or believed: and know not any reason for the day prac-\ntice, of which you appeal.\n\n8. There can be but one answer, No Christian can do it with a clean\nconscience. Nay more, he cannot imprison the infidel or the heathen.\nThis answers W.9\n\n10. If there be no allegation or belief of proud, I can hardly [illegible]\nthe power to imprison for debt arbitrarily, as anything more\nthan personal tyranny, the relic of a [illegible], unjust rage, inca-\npable of estimating the value and dignity of personal rights,\nThe disproportion is erroneous.\n\n11. I am satisfied no evils would result from abolishing im-\nprisonment from debt, provided proper precautious be [illegible]\nto protect the Creditor, and subject the unwilling or fraudulent\nDebtor to the law of imprisonment—\n\n12. I think the following would be [done?] of the advantage resul-\nting from the abolition of imprisonment for debt. 1. personal rights\nwould acquire a new value and a higher dignity. 2. In prison duty\nfor debt—would be confined to its proper object, err as a reasona:\n:ble means adapted to the attainment of an important lawful end.\n3. Imprisonment—for debt [instead of being regarded as in no res-\npect disgraceful, but-rather a misfortune] would that be regar-\nded as absolutely dishonorable and this would be a powerful\ninducement to escape it. 4. To considerate Mean would subject a:\n\n[End page 2]\n\nnother to this ordeal; but under circumstances of just suspicion. 5. Im-\nprisonment for debt would never be used, as it too often is, not for the\nlegitimate purpose of obtaining the Debtors properly; but to extort\nmoney or security from friends or relations.\n\n13. Never, that I remember; tho I really believe I have lost debts\nwhich I might otherwise have recovered. My end would have been\nattained, under a proper system.\n\n14. My experience is that the Ca. Sa. has scarcely ever have been\nof any avail; far, far less efficient, that a well conducted system\nwould make it. I have nothing further to add [illegible] this [illegible]\nas a statement at large, of the scheme I should propose, would\nbe the best commentary or explanation of my [illegible] views.\nI thank you for the volume of the P[illegible] Society, han-\nded to me by Mr. Jasper [Couring?]. Let me request your acceptance\nin return of the address herewith, on the expediency and duty of\nadopting the Bible as a Class Book through the whole Court of\neducation from the preliminary School to the University.\n\nYrs Respectfully\nThos. S. Grimke\n\nThe Revd. Louis Dwight\nBoston\n\nI have confused what I have said in answer to your en-\nquiries, to the case of taking the body under the Ca:Sa: or final\nprocess to couple payment of the debt, I think that the Creditor\nshould have the privilege, not the common right as in the Case\nof arresting the Defendant or bail process, to Complete security\n\n[End page 3]\n\n for the debt, I would abolish the general right but would al-\nlow the creditor to employ this process [illegible], in addition to\nthe Customary affidavit of the debt, he would add an oath either\nthat the debt was insecured in his belief or that the Defendant\nwas about to quit the State, or alleging feud or Concealment,\nor unfairness in the Contracting of the debt\n\nMy experience and [illegible], after twenty years prac-\ntice are that in Mine out of Few cases, and I am not sure, but\nthat I might say, in nineteen out of twenty the property as-\nsigned now so [illegible] or of such doubtful Character that\nno one would act as Assignee.\n\n-1830\nLouis Dwight\n-[Cellum?]\n\n[End page 4]"
