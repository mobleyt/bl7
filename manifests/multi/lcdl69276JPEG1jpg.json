      "value": "May \nxxxxx 9, 1947\nMr Armant Legendre,\nOtis McAllister Co., Ltd.,\n510 N. Dearborn Ave.,\nChicago, ILL.\nHey,\nI have been reading with interest in the Wall\nSt. Journal about the Roasters howling like wolves and\nsaying they cannot take another bag of coffee until\nthe end of the world. Also the retailers saying that\nthey had cases of coffee piled up in their wharehouses\nuntil the walls were bulging. It is all very interesting\nand I am certain that Mr Otis and Mr McAllister are also\nvery interested. Let me know how things are going\nwhenever you get a chance and if you run into any\ngood soft beans, hot roast sweet to the taste engage\nher for the office.\nNew Orleans was really fun and I cannot thank\nyou enough. I always enjoy myself to the limit there\nand still exude a little gumbo whenever my ears are\nbent forward by the plantation winds. That golf\ngame was the highspot. I think poor Perry shooting\na seventy to win us five bucks and not getting anything\nhimself was the worst deal that we have ever pulled.\nI am still asha ed of myself not only for that but for\nthe miserable appearance we put in walking with our\nclubs over our shoulders while our hired employee was\nbattling away to make us money.\nThe plantation is the same as ever. And after\nthinking it over I am going to give you a small inter st in\nin it so that you too may have the pleasure of handling\nthe bulls and horses. Two nights ago two of the bulls\nbroke out of their pasture and rushing over to the\npasture where the oldes bull lived challenged him to a\nfight. I heard this terrible bellowlng going on and\nwent out to find them each charging the fence on their\nrespective sides and buttlng the hell out it. Fortunately\nthey hit the fence on opposite sides at the same time\nso that it did nothing but hurt their heads, the fence\nbeing under no strain. If I had been a you ger man I\nwould have driven them off ? but in this case went to\nbed and shut my windows so I would not the bellowing.\n[End Page 1]\nAm going over to see fat belly this\nevening. He is engaged in some deal whereby widows are\nweeping and wringing their hands. It is so envolved\nthat I cannot follow it at all. Guess I will just \nstick to the simple life.\nGoodbye old man. I am leaving here on\nthe 18th. Will see you at Foxcroft if not before. \nGertrude fixed it up so that youare staying with Olive\nand Mimi at one of those swell hunting houses, with lots\nof horses and servants, the kind of place that you like.\nGertie just came down from Foxcrof yester day and said\nthat Katherine is not only t e favorite of the school\nbut of Miss Charlottes also.\n[End Page 2]"
