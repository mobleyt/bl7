      "value": "Dr. John Lynch Columbia August 28th 1859 Dear Brother I wrote you two letters a few days ago, in the last which I requested to be forwarded I enclosed a measurement of the windows and advised your being here at the time of trial, the Court and Jury made a mistrial yesterday, the case will be tried again on Tuesday 30th. Mr Bellinger thinks your pressure would not advance your cause, therefore thinks it best for you to remain away till after the trial. I have no doubt of the result of the trial on next Tuesday, the spirit evinced by Thompson, the crowd around him and the jury making a mistrial after the evidence has procured quite a sensation in the community, which I have no doubt will make the next jury take an impartial view of the case and be of service to the School afterwards. You had best get the blinds as soon as possible, as Sister Ellen wishes to move in at once after the blinds and doors are fixed, the other alterations she could be present at, I have partially engaged a carpenter to do all the alterations [End Page 1] Sister Ellen received a letter from you postmarked Philadelphia Aug 24th, please let me know as soon as you return to Charleston, it strikes me your interest has not been pushed if they have been looked to carefully. What will be the cost of the courts and who will it fall on, is a question I have not asked Mr Bellinger, if on Thompson he is not able to pay a cent, so the other party may have to pay, this though we will see in the mean time Yours affectionately John [End Page 2]"
