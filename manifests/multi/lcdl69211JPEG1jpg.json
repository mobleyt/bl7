      "value": "25\nCopy to\n1528 31st. Street, Washington.\nOriginal to London\nJuly 20, 1 43\nMrs Sidney J. Legendre\nNational City Bank of New York,\n11 Waterloo Place\nLondon.\nDear Gertie,\nYour letters of July 10th and 14th arrived\nwith this evenings mail at the office and I brought them\nhome to read and rexread them. I laughed when I read that\nWing Peter said we were the stars of surfboarding. That\nis as ridiculous as the Dillingham story about my being\ndrunk. Morris and I have never ridden a wave all the waxy\nin, we fall off almost immediately, and to boot never even\ncatch more than two waves an afternoon, although we may try\nfor one hundred. It seems th t it requires a real knack\nand we just have n t been able to get it. As I told you in\nmy last letter there has not been any surf for three weeks\nand as a result we have sto[pp]ed going ot the outrigger.\nThis afternoon weplayed tennis again and it was great fun.\nOld man Morris beat me two sets easily, without even\nmaking an effort and then we came home and cooked a marvelous\ncasserole of chicken, lima beans and rice. Everything\nfresh out of a can and very good. After eating until our\nstomachs were popping we serenly went to our own rooms, s[H]ut\nthe doors and lay down on our beds. He to read and I to\nwrite you.\nThe book \"Thunder in Heaven\"is written by a \nwomen. Don't you remember several years ago she wrote a\nbook and we read the synopisis of it in the readers digest.\nIt was about a girl raised on a ranch on the island of Hawai\nby her farther who was the manager. You liked it so much.\nShe is also the Author of Thunder in Heaven[,]which is rather\ndepressing [book] as the girl foolishly kills her own husba[N]d when\nthere is nothing the matter with him. There is too much\nsadness in the orld without reading about it in books.\nI have not heard from you as to whether Anderson is defini[ly]\ngoing to handle my books and whether instructions have be\ngiven to the Guaranty Trust Co. to send him a l the neces\ninformation. Please let me know about this.\nI too remember some of the lovely things we di\ntogether at Medway, and for all we know we may be delight[ed]\nto end up living there the rest of our lives. However\nmy arguments against it are:\n[End Page 1]\n1. It is too expensive. Beyond our income so that\nrunning it is like running a business always trying\nto meet thepayroll and yet never having the fun or the\npossibility of getting ahead of the expensi-ses. \n2. We were isolated from all other people and sources of  \namusment except those created by o[u]rselves. The result was\nthat we depended -upon one andrther for our exercises and \npleasures. This would have been ideal had we been evenly\nblessed with energy. Unforturately you possessed too much\nand I too little for a proper balance and after I was whipped\nfrom a monnings ride you were just limbered up for an afternoons\ntennis or quail shooting. There was no other form of amus-  \nfor you and if I did not go out again you would be left alone\nwith nothing to do. You remember we discussed this often.\nThe result of this of course was that I was always tired,\nto tired to want to see peoole, who we[r]e always there, to\ntired to do anthiny byt lie on the sofa at the end of the\nday a expire.\n3. It is an impossible pl ce to bring up children. I feel  \nwe did Landine a great wrong by forcing her to live in a  \nboarxding house with a nurse all her formative years and I\nwould like to give Bo a better chance.\n4. I do not want to cope [w]ith the ever breaking down of the \nhouse, the tractors, the banks etc. No matter whether we\nwalked , rode or sat on the terrace the conversation invariably\nturned to \"this bridge has to be fixed. Did'nt you just \nhear a shot, I think it must bepoachers, These porch chairs\nare terrible, we must have them recovered. I think this - H;\nhorse is lame in the front foot. You know how it was[,]one\npetty worry after another.\nWhere we will live I do not know. I do not want to live\nin a city at all. In fact would hate it. But I do want t o\nlive near enough to other people so that we can have tennis\ngolf, and riding, If we want to farm a little there will\nbe someone to talk to about it. etc. Hawaii may not be\nright, I do not know. We will try and live in different\nplaces until we find some thing that appeals to us both.\nProviding of course that this war does not run into another\none before I am even released from the service.\nMy Navy Number is 159922 and my commanding officer is\nCaptain W.G. Goggins. I should think the Navy would have\nthat information in their files and it would not be necessry\nforthem to ask you.\nGoodbye darling, I have not the faintsest idea whether\nthis letter will find you abroad or in the states, but\nwhereever you are it carries all my love, both the copy\nand the original.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
