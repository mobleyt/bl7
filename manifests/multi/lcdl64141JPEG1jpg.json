      "value": "[William Davies to Nathanael Greene\nJune 2, 1781\n[RvW Box 1 Folder 11; MSS. â€“ A.L.S.]]\n\nCharlottesville June 2, 1781\nSir,\nI am but just returned from attending\nthe Baron, and am not yet able to say he is in readi;\nness to march. Shoes and some other articles of cloath-\ning he has not yet got; and cartridge boxes are\nvery much wanting. I think the former may be\nprocured; but I doubt our ability to furnish the latter.\nThe incursions of the enemy have thrown every\nthing into great confusion, as well as filled the\nminds of the people with the greatest discontent\nparticularly with Baron Steuben, as they think\nhe is disposed to leave them without assistance.\nIt is a cause of great dissatisfaction that the\nnew levies should be taken out of the State, when\ntheir presence is so much wanting in it. The dis-\nstance from hence to you is such that I fear\nmany letters are intercepted, and that the true\nsituation of this country is unknown to you.\nIndeed, I have often thought it was very dangerous\nfor the secrets of government and the designs of the\ncommanding generals to be so much exposed to \nthe knowledge of the enemy, as they always will\nbe till a proper cypher is adopted. At present there\n[End Page 1]\nis very little information here of the real state of\nsouthern affairs, or of the immediate necessity of\nthe march of a reinforcement to you, while\nthis State is attacked with so numerous a\nbody of the enemy. This is the general talk. For\nmy own part I am much at a loss what to deter-\nmine. The support of your army is nearly con-\nnected with the security of this State and the safety\nof the stores. At present the Marquis is much in-\nferior in number of men, and the stores are\nin great danger: yet if the Baron on the other\nhand should join him, he would still be in-\nferior and not able to secure them. Should he\nmarch to you, it would probably give you so\ndecided a superiority, for a while at least,\nas perhaps to enable government to be reinstu-\nted in South Carolina, and more firmly established\nin the North State. This I think would have a con\nsiderable influence in Europe, when the world saw\nthat altho' the enemy overrun the Southern State\none after the other, yet the moment they left\nthem, they lost them. I am, however, much\ndisturbed at the refractory conduct of some\nof our own citizens. Augusta and some\nother counties have refused the draft, and \n[End Page 2]\nin Hampshire they have made an open insur-\nrection, with a considerable number in arms.\nGeneral Morgan has march'd against them,\nand it is reported altho' much doubted that\nhe has dispersed them, hanged some and\nconfined others.\nWe have had two or three supplies of\narms from the northward, purchased\nby the State, I hope it will enable us to\ndefend ourselves something better than\nwe have hitherto done; tho' I am very ap-\nprehensive such arrangements will be\nadopted this session of Assembly as wil[l]\nma[ke] matters worse than ever.\nI have the honor to be, Sir, with [the]\ngreatest respect and esteem,\nYour most obedient hble Servt. [humble Servant]\nWilliam Davies\n[End Page 3]\n[Endorsed: note written upside down]\nThis with other Letters which accompany it I recd. about\none Hour Agoo [sic], Now forwarded to Charlotte, 7 [pm] Special\nExpress Seven oClock--------- P.M June 26th 1781\n[From Salisbury]. John Dunn Dist QMG\n[Addressed:]\n[public service]\nHonorable Major General Greene\nexpress\nHead quarters -\n[seal]\n[Endorsed: written upside down]\nFrom Col.
