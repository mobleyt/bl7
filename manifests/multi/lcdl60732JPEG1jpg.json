      "value": "Sept 24, 1966\nMy job is enjoyable to me\nMy job is working with Grass. Roots and underprivileged people,\nwho are being denied many of the better things in life. I like this job because \nit is a Challenge to me. In 1948, I called a group of John's Island people together\nto organize what is called the progressive club. We set our own goals and agreed to work\ntogether to attain them. First, we felt that those of our group who were living on \nplantations or other peoples lands, should be encourage and helped to buy lands [sic] of \ntheir own and build their homes so that they and their children might have freedom to attend schools. \nWe set up an Adult Citizenship School to help the adults in reading and writing. So they would be able to register \nand vote at the proper time. \nIn 1950 we asked the school board to build us one Consolidated School with four years high, \nplus the[y] needed buses that our children may ride to school just as the white children do.\nThis was done and all of the above metnion[sic] goals for the John's Island people were reached\nand as a result the groups is[sic] now smiling. This make me happy also."
