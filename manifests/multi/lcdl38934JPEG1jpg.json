      "value": "Savannah 17th Apl. 1866 James B. Heyward Esq Combahee So. Ca. Dear James I write on a very important subject. My own observations here and in general with regard to labor and land and our future prospect are such that I have come to the conclusion we cannot plant on our former scale. The result will be that our lands will deteriorate in value from neglect- rice fields being peculiarly liable to this deterioration in value. We must on the same principle that induced the famous English Farmer Mechi, to sell one of two excellent Farms in order to improve the remaining one - sell some of our land and give our whole attention to the rest. I have had some very interesting conversations with practical gentlemen here - Allen Izard John Richardson and others. The labor here is scarce and very dear, enormously dear; laborers asking and getting besides rations the most liberal $15. a month. carpenters $2.00 per day, under contract. Day-laborers receive for trenching an acre one dollar and full rations - and now cannot be had for that. Women ask $1.50 for sowing an acre. The competition is frightful and the planters are literally cutting one another's throats. The old labor is destroyed [End Page 1] and at these prices (which the insolent and rapacious negroes are exacting under the threat of leaving us without anyone to put the seed into the ground) every body says if Rice falls we will not pay expenses. I am doing my best, working hard and will get in 225 acres by Thursday planted and under water. But the struggle is dreadful. I have done wonders considering the material- and the time I have been here, but can make no calculations even for a day ahead. John Richardson who is eminently a practical man thinks that the difficulty is owing to so many negros having gone to the West. He thinks they will nearly all go there where they can afford to give $20 per month. We can never do this and live. On being asked whether he would sell land. He said certainly if he could on Savannah River at what prices? He said $100. in Greenbacks per acre he would jump at. much less than the value before the war but that a man could take the money and do much better with it. Suppose he had sold for instance and invested in stocks say city of Charleston stock 6 per cent. This is rising every day - selling now- at 55 to 65. If it rises [illegible]- we would get back our money in gold. If Fife could be sold for $75.000. the return [End Page 2] would be $4500. I doubt if we will ever realize this by planting The expenses are enormous and growing every day. Besides where is the remedy against stealing and open robbery? We are as Richardson says the most helpless men now in the world. We have no friends and we cannot write it seems, on any subject. I [decisively?] think you had better let me sell Fife. I think Mr Chadwick who is a man of large means and very full of enterprise would have given for it at one time $75.000. It would have been our salvation, given comfort to our families and enabled us to concentrate all our strength, energy and mind upon our other property. Mr Chadwick is expected back here in about two weeks. I have organized Fife with wonderful good fortune and am also planting more lands. The Fife negroes contracted on stringent terms, but as good as those of my neighbors. $15. and Rations. But they are from the neighborhood of the town troublesome and turbulent like all the negroes hereabouts. Next year we will have no funds to start with and they will probably abandon the plantation, as other negroes have done. We will then be without labor- for a slave in the crop fields little [illegible] here. Carpenter Peter, Joe, George, Wm. Moses and Quash will hear of nothing but weekly wages [End Page 3] to be paid on Saturday night. It makes the Planter a slave, far worse than his slave used to be. It is hard work and no pay for us- My situation, people say, is better than that of most persons and yet you see what the prospect is- If Rice falls to one dollar per Bushel we will hardly meet expenses- While things are in this transitive state many planters have offered their lands for sale. Joe Manigualt failed to sell his for $100 per acre. Joe Huger failed to sell his at the same price. Others have offered lands and failed to meet purchases. Now if we, from our peculiar situation as organized and working should be able to sell Fife for $75.000 or even $65.000 cash, to be invested in City Stock, we had better do so without hesitation. We will never have another such opportunity. Unles we sell the debt upon it, although so small, will eventually eat it up. I have been reflecting deeply on this subject, whie your attention has been turned to other matters and have come to the same conclusion with the other gentlemen here. Any one of them would sell at a moments warning and take $100. per acre in Greenbacks. Write me word immediately, as time presses. I dont say I can sell I only want to be empowered to do so. We can never build the [illegible] &c. again with present labor and things get worse every day. If a monied Northern man chooses he can afford to run the risk- (but we cant afford it!) of waiting the further development of the labor question. Labor at the north is so dear that negroes are going there by thousands at $20. per month! Write to Savannah and care of Phillips & Myers [in print:] (Phillips & Myers) Yours truly Wm Henry Heyward.
