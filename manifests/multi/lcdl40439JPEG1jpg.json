      "value": "Asheville Oct 22 I received your letter this evening Dear Stephen & hasten to answer it & express my sincere pleasure at its contents. You know I have always been anxious for you to marry, but dreaded your being drawn into it, to avoid being an old bachelor, therefore I was too delighted to find you were smitten by the [illegible] at last -- for I have very often [illegible] that you were something of a flirt, but had never been in love with any of the numerous \"friends\" your name had been coupled with. I cant say your news was a complete surprise [Sideways on top of page]: Home about the income that was only a living for a single man! I am so glad I heard it from you first & thank you for remembering me.[End Page 1] for I had heard numerous reports. As I dont know the lady I can say nothing, but think I can trust to your choice & if you both care for each other that is the chief thing. I will enclose a few lines to her which you can give her if you like, and this is a great proof of my affection for I dislike those kind of letters generally. i am too too sorry to miss your visit home indeed it is a great grief, but it will be impossible for me to leave here in time. Edmund has bought a farm at Flat Rock and they expect to move as soon as Edmund can dispose of or remove his farm produce. It will be every[End Page 2] thing to chance to have me with her during the move as Edmund can then go backwards & forwards, but could not leave Nancie alone, then of course I would like to see Nancie fixed in her new home as I dont know when I will pay her a visit again it is so expensive. Our little God daughter was christened yesterday. Mr Howe, who christened Belle was up here so Edmund & Nancie were glad to have him do the same for Kate for that is to be her name -- she is the best little baby there ever was, much better than Belle at her age. I don't know whether you have heard from home lately, Allard wrote me he had lost his place as agent[End Page 3] & was going to Savannah to try & get business. He seemed hopeful but fearful that his marriage would be delayed I would not be surprised you get ahead of him in that line. Joseph I hear has just returned from a visit to Cincinnati, he seems to be a lucky dog. You know too well my dear brother my deep love for you, for me to reiterate my expressions of delight in your happiness. A brother or sisters marriage has always something of pain in it but I have been so truly anxious & [illegible] thankful for your happiness that I cheerfully accept the second place in your affections that is if you promise to try & not give me up altogether. With heartfelt wishes & earnest prayers for your welfare & happiness your fond sister Hettie[End Page 4]"
