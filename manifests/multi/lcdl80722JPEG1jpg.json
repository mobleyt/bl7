      "value": "Columbus 20th Sept\n\nDear Brother\nReturned last evening from\nthe circuit in a remote part of the State\nwhen I received the letters which bring the\nmelancholy and afflicting intelligence of the\ndeath of our most excellent Parent. This was an event\nwhich I feared would take place soon, con-\nfident that his delicate constitution could\nwith difficulty, at his period of life, [illegible]\nany very serious disease. But I had most\nardently hoped, that it would have been in\nmy power to have visited and convened\nwith him before this awful dispensation.\nMy recent appointment however, and the conse-\nquent duties which were immediately com-\nmitted to me, rendered this impossible.\nIt is however a sweet consolation that he\nwas attended in sickness and in his dying\nmoments by one who is so admirably fitted\nfor that angel office as Sarah.- She has\nbeen most truly as you rewarded an active\nand useful citing in his day, and I do\nbelieve would have been even more dis-\n[tressing?] [ordeal?] among what are and [illegible]\n\n[End page 1]\n\nterred new of intellect if he had been\nfree from the cares and [niceties?] of a large\nfamily, to whose welfare he has through\nthe whole period of our remembrance, de-\nvoted himself most ardently and faithfully.\nI have met even in this remote quarter with\nmany persons, who remember him in that was\nduring he was so useful, and who [illegible] the\nprofoundest respect for his character. He has\nprobably discharged the duties of the high\noffice which he filled during a longer period\nthan any other member of a court in this\ncountry or perhaps and other, and I know has\ndischarged these with ability and singular\nfaithfulness. Although not possessing a very\nlarge share of learning, he was endowed with\nthe [illegible] talent of most excellent sense which\nis capable of being carried not only into the\n[practical?] affairs of life; but even into the\nDistant [illegible] of Science.- He has died univer-\nsally reversed by the good of all classes, and\nit is a deep consolation to us that for some\nyears previous to his death he had been most\ntimidly [impressed?] with the truth and the\nexcellence of religion, and that he has\ndied the death of the righteous.\n\n[End page 2]\n\nI received the papers which you were so kind\nas to send me, among which was the eloquent\neulogies on Mr Frost, and wrote you in answer\nfrom Dayton [on the Great Miami river] on\n7th instant, and the day previous of and\nthe Yellow Springs to Eliza, both of while\nletters I hope will reach you. I am [putatively?]\nat a loss to account for the frequent miscarriage\nof my letters. Sarah in her letter which I received\nlast night says she has written to me repeatedly\nand I have now since leaving home received\nbut one from her. I received one from Eliza\nlast night dated 3d August. but there are\ntwo from her previous to that which I miss.\nLet me know if she received my letter\nof 7th August inclosing a copy of the\nletter from the Governor [to deferring?]\nto me my appointment, and whether\nyou have received the Columbus Gazette\ncontaining my first charge to the G. Jury.\nI am obliged to [illegible] off again immediately\nfor Delaware a Town twenty five miles\nNorth of this place, and when the Circuit\nwill close for further present. After that\nI shall be at leisure to unite to you all\nwho have been so kind as to remember\none so undeserving. Ever and affectionately,\nF Grimke\n\n[End page 3]\n\nNo. 2- Md.
