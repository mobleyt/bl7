      "value": "Chillicothe 30 Aug. 1861.\nDear Anne\n\nI have just finished a fifth num-\nber of [reflections?] on the present state of public affairs, and take \nup my pen to answer your of the 5th You observe therefore th-\nat I have departed from the resolution I had [found?], not to\ntake up my pen, until the horizon had cleared up, and a bright-\ner prospect had opened before us. I found that I could not shake\noff the anxieties, which incessantly haunted me, in any other\nway than by giving free utterance to my feelings, and Presumed\nmy pen in order to afford a relic if to my mind. It is very I-\n[illegible], that the democratic party in the North, have not been si-\nlenced; nor have they joined the [mouths?] of the other party; for I\nfind that my articles, have been hailed by the former with un-\nbounded satisfaction. The editor of \"The Crisis\" published at Co-\nlumbus closes a long notice of them, by saying \"thrilling in their\nwarnings to the American people; whose spirit of independence\nis not yet dead in them they will arouse the Nation to the [illegible], and\nagonizing dangers which beset them\" It is evident also from the\nfact, that four editors of newspapers in [illegible] been a [illegible] to\nbe arraigned before the courts, for giving utterance to \n\n[End page 1]\n\n[illegible] so many instances of bold violations of the law, that\nI shall not be surprised, if the administration [leafs?] over many\nmore [illegible], in order to vent their [illegible] against the South.\nThey must be very much alarmed by the [vent?], and consternation\nat [Manassa?], when they [illegible] to make war upon private\ncorrespondence.-The agent here, of Adams' express informed me that it\nwas their practice to carry letters to some Post Office in the [illegible]\nstates, and there [illegible] them, and yet the informed that\nnone other than [in?] States stamp was necessary. Now I cannot\nunderstand how a letter placed in a Post Office in the [illegible]\nStates should reach the place of distinction un-\nless a stamp of the Confederate States was [assigned?] to it. I can\nunderstand why I should have viewed a letter from Mon-\ntague lately, which had only on U States stamp. because it\nwas deposited in P Office in Kentucky; for Kentucky\nhas not seceded. Perhaps there may be some understand-\ning between the Express, and the Southern government,\nwhich this consents to sacrifice the revenue which would\nbe derived from its P Office rather than place any impediment\nin the way of private correspondence [illegible], it is in striking\ncontrast with the course pursued by the U States.\nThe placard which you enclosed me, [brother?] strong by of revo-\nlutionary times: it reminds one of the atrocious proceedings\nduring the French Revolution, when Robespierre, Dauton,\nand Sautene made the scaffold flow with blood, and\nspared neither sex, nor age. As [illegible], I have heard of\nnothing being done, it is to be preserved that the [illegible]\nwho uttered such horrid threats, against their fellow ci-\ntizens, failed in courage, and that the plan of [presuming?]\nindictments has been adopted. But as we have no sedi-\ntion law, I do not see how they can possibly succeed in the\nnew plan they have fallen upon. The constitution secures\nfreedom of speech, and of the press, and I am sure that\nthe savage threats which proceed from the press of the\nrepublican party, are much more calculated to lead\nto breaches of the peace, than the warnings where have\ncontained in the democratic [illegible] papers.\n\n[End page 2]\n\nI state and the matter too strongly, when I said Great Britain,\nand France had recognized the independence of the\nSouthern Confederacy. They have made no formal recog-\nnition of its independence. Nevertheless they have given\nthe most unmistakable proof, that they consider it so,\nand that it is their fixed determination to make a\nformal recognition before very long. Great numbers of\nagents from both France and England, have visited\nthe southern states during all this summer, for the\npurpose of contracting for the purchase of the incom-\ning crop of cotton. If they are the private agents of the\ngreat [illegible] factoring establishment in those coun-\ntries, there must be a perfect understanding between\nthem and the government, and if as has been said, they\nare the direct agents of those governments, the dye\nis already cast, and an open recognition is certain. All\nthe leading newspapers, in England, of both the Tory\nand Whig party, are loud in their commendations\nof President David government, and are not spar-\ning in their reproaches of President Lincolns. I have\nbefore me, extracts from no less than five of the [most?]\ninfluential english newspapers, all of which are\nopenly in favor of the southern republic. It is very\nmuch the same with the French newspapers, they\nexhibit the same tone, and hold the same language.\nThe present prime minister of England, Lord Pal-\nmerston has been distingusihed during the whole of\nthis public life, for alarming towards republics. In\nthe civil wars of Spain, Portugal and Switzerland,\nhe invariably sided with the oppressed party, and\nin the war between Hungary, and Austria, he showed\nthe same disposition; while on the other hand Lord\nDerby, the [illegible] of the Tory party, and prime minister\njust before Palmerston has disclosed himself decidedly\nin favor of the Confederate States.\nRemember me to Mary Anna.\n\nEver yours affy. \nF. Grimke\n\n[End page 3]\n\n[To] Anna R Frost\nNorth Orange\nNew Jersey\n\n[Postmarked] Chillicothe\nAug 31 1831\n\n[End page 4]"
