  "description": "This is the second page of a letter written to \"William\" from Elias Rivers on April 29, 1895. On this page, Mr. Rivers details the second part of the meeting of 14 men from James Island who had served in the Civil War. After eating dinner, the letters and excuses of those unable to come were read. Those who were absent included: Dr. J.L. Girardeau, Stiles Mellichamp, Capt. H.S. Lebby, W.W. Lawton, Dr. J.H. Mellichamp, E.M. Freer, W.A. Mellichamp, and William Rivers. The names of those who had died during the war were also read and included: Edward H. Mellichamp, Stiles M. Hinson, Joseph M. Mellichamp, J. Peronneau Royall, W.S. Mellichamp, J.C. Seabrook, Campbell Holmes, and Rawlins H. Rivers. In the afternoon, the photographs of those present were taken and the evening was spent talking. The men left after breakfast the next day. It is noted that the only alcohol consumed was a bottle of wine from 1835 that had survived the war by being buried when Sherman passed through South Carolina in 1865.",
