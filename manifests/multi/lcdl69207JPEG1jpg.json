      "value": "22\nJuly 14, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nWhat a wonderful sight you missed this evening.\nMorris and I decided that we did not want to go swimming\nand played tennis instead at the Royal Hawaiian. You know\nhow two fat jews look the morning after they have arrived at\na summer hotel. They go to the court with a string bag full\nof gray, dead balls and funny shaped rackets th t they have\nborrowed from a friend who played the previous summer. They\nwear very short shorts and theirderriers stick out behind and\ntheir stomachs fall over the front of the shorts. They talk\na great deal about \"vell hit the ball vy doan yon hit it\"\nand that is as far as their game goes. Ours was just the\nsame. A terrifc battle in which there were no rallies. I was\nbeaten seven to five and we had to help each other off the court\nNever have I felt so awarkward and clumsy. The r[A]_cket felt\nlike some strange unknown instrument in my hand, and my feet\nand legs were like those of that Frenchmans who kept crying\nat Vichy th t he had \"les jambes coupes\" However sitting\nin my room and trying to cool off as I write this I fee[l] one\nhundred times better than I have ever done after swimming.\nIt is such a different form of exercise. Tennis makes your\nblood circulate and your muscles move. Swimming you just\nfloat along blowing bubbles without ever even taking a deep\nbreath. I hope we will play some more, but I don't know, it\nis sort of hard to get the old man out on the court.\nLast night was mardi Gras in Honolulu. We were all wed\nto have our lights on providing the shades were pulled down\nbelow the levels of the lights. Crowds walked up and down\nohing and ahing at the lights and it gave me a great thrill\nto see them again. They looked so strange, one felt instincteiv\nsomething was wrong and your first instict was to yell \" hey\nyour light is showing\" No one sat i[N] their living rooms as they\nwere all outside walking around looking into other peoples\nliving rooms. Then a funny thing happened. Suddenly the lights\nbegan to go out and in their place the dim black out bulbs came\non. People could not stand the bright lights in their eyes.\nThey were to glary, and not nerely [A]s peacful as the faint\nglow of the other bulbs. I tried to sit in our l ving room\nwith the lights on but they gave me the jum s, so I ended by\nturning them off and going into my bedroom and reading there\nas I have been doing for the past eleventh months. Eleventh\nmonths. Think of that. Almost a year out here. A year away\nfrom you. You and I who have ne er been seperated, who moved\nas one. It seems incredible that this happened and continues to\nhappen. I thihk of youall the time dear, wonder what you are\n[End Page 1]\ndoing and what we are going to do when this war is over.\nI went out to see A Mr Daltons house which is for sale on\nSunday. There was a spaniel there that absolutely broke\nmy heart. He did everythingClippy use to do. Ran in c rcles,\nsneezed and put his paws up. I wanted to hug him so badly.\nThis house is for sale. Morris and I go every Sunday morning wit\na real estate dealer to see different houses. In this way we hop\nto get and idea what prices should be and why. As yet I have\nnot the slightest idea. The Topping house which sold with all\nits furniture, tennis court, swimming pool and lovely grounds\nfor fifty thousand was one price. Lester McCoys house is\nfor sale for two hundred and twenty five thousand andis not\nnearly as attractive. No tennis court or swimming pool and \nvery dark and dreary.\nMr Daltons House is at Kahala. You turn left from\nthe roads towards the sea and [p]ass between two fat gate posts.\nImmediately on the leftt is a tennis court[,] the backstops\nheave with star jasmine. To your right are clumps of white and\npurple oleander bushes through when you catch glimpses of lawns\nand enormous shade trees. The road curves around a clump of tall\npalms and rejoins itself. We left the car here and went through\nan opening in a Hibiscus hedge [to] find ourselves facing the\nblue waters of a swimming pool shimmering in the sun while beyond\nacross a stretch of green grass the sea rolled in in great white\ncombers over the reef. To the left at the end of the pool\nwas a little palm th tched hut in the shade of which blue chairs\nsat as if mirroring the w ters of the pool. At one side of the\nbut was a tiny bar made rom a surfboard. We left this scene\nof delight and turning to our right away from the pool passed\nbetween some yellow flowering bushes and into the house itslef.\nThere is noth ng to tell. It was cery dissapointing. Rooms all\ncho[p]ped up and filled with french furniture. Cornices and mantel\npieces that the owner informed us with pride were brought from\nthe mainland. Machine made copies of charleston rooms, can you\nimagine it, here in this tropical island. A land of staw mats\nand bamboo furniture, to have such atrocitires. But I did not\nreally look at the house because the spaniel was bouncing around\nbegging to be taken for a walk and snuffling under all the\nbeds[,]as if he did not know very well there was nothing there.\nWe went [scratched through] out into the garden which was lovely.\nNow so large that one man could not take care of it, but at the\nsame time it gave a great feeling of space. Something that I din\none misses here shut in as you are by the heavy vegetation.\nThe lawn wove and curved betwenn and around lovely flowering bush\nhes and the[N]belled out [to] sorrounded an enormous shade tree,\na lovely old th ng whose trunk was covered with the shiny leaves\nof some vine and tiny little orchids that seemed to fl[o]at in the\nair. To one side was a little ro[c]k pool almost hidden by the\nflowers and creepers [scratched through] [at] its sides. It was full of xx\nshadows and lights out of which tiny little [fis]hes darted and\ndissappeared almost as fast as flickers of l ght themselves.\n[End Page 2]\nAt the end of seeing all and Morris finding that he knew many\npeople that Mr Dalton did, Mr Lewis Thompson, Pussy Thompsons\nfather in Redbank, Tom McCarter etc. We asked the price.\nOnly two hundred and ten thousand to us as we were almost old\nfriends. By the by he said Pussy had married a professor who\nwas teaching at Princeton .\nI received a copy of a letter from Miss Finucan to you\ndated June 24th. Is she still with us or have you fired her.\nPlease be sure and number y ur letters when you get to England\nas I know I am missing lots of them as you contiual refer in\none letter to something that I have never heard from you about.\nGoodbye darling. I send you all my love and best wishes\nfor your trip. God bless and keep you until I can hold you\nin my arms again. \nSidney J Legendre\nPS I sent you two letters one dated Julu 11th. and one\nJuly 12th. I forgot to number them so please put the\nfollwing numbers on themif they have been received\nin order that you may check and see if any are missing.\n[End Page 3]"
