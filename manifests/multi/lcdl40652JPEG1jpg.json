      "value": "Bivouac at Orange C.H., August 8th My Dear Mama, I wrote to Maddie on the 28th and to you on the 30th July from Richmond, then again to you on the 3rd Aug. from Gordonsville. Do tell me if all the letters came to hand. I wrote to Aunt Sarah on the 2nd and to Papa and Maria on the 4th. We left our camp near Gordonsville night before last. We are now at Orange Court House, where we bivouacked last night. I do not know whether I will have time to finish this letter, as the Brigade is only waiting for the Road to be cleared, before it starts. We are in the neighborhood of the enemy, and skirmishing has been going on all morning. The advanced portion of the army took 130 prisoners here last night. It is reported now that the enemy has fallen back. If any thing stirring takes place of course you will hear it all by telegraph before you receive this. This portion of the country is pleasanter much than that about Richmond. We are in the mountains, about 15 or 20 miles from the Blue Ridge. But still it is terribly hot marching, and Jackson has no mercy on his army on a march. I never saw such fast marching in my[End Page 1] life before. The only thing I am afraid of is that we will now get out of the way of mail communication, and even when we are where we could get the mail, it is not sent, for Jackson goes about so fast that they do not know in Richmond, where to send it to [illegible]. All you letters have come pretty regularly lately. I received that of the 30th on the 4th in five days, but I have not received the one that you gave to a member of [Oxn?] Regt. to bring for me. However I shall write wherever I have our an opportunity, for you must be more anxious about all of us out in the field, than we are about you at home, but still you must write often, for when I am where I can get the letters, and do not get them, it makes me afraid that you are sick or something wrong has happened. I am constantly afraid of hearing that you are sick again. What a horrible thing that Minnie Whaly should have eloped. Have you heard any thing of her? What sort of a man is it that she eloped with? Is he a gentleman? Do tell me all about it when you write. I have hired a boy, and am getting on very well with him. He is a free boy. I pay him $8 dollars a month. I would like above all things to get into some fixed position. Here in the[End Page 2] field there is no chance of my ever of leaving on furlough, and then the life is so disagreeable. How do Ella and Nan, and all of them get along there. I enclosed a letter to Mimmy in my last to you. If I were not with a Regt. I would enjoy travelling about this country. It would be a delightful country to reside in. I told you in my last that if you should let me have Aunt Vs address, I would write to her. Have you heard from them all lately? I think that I shall write to Johny, and direct the letter to Charleston, but I do not know whether he will get it. I am so glad to hear that Jem is better. I would really like to hear how Paris speaks at home of his Virginia campaign. I suppose he makes a perfect hero of himself. But I must hurry this off. Do give my love to all. Ask Papa to write. Remember me to [Jane?] and all the servants. Your Affectionate Son, W. [End Page 3] Soldiers Letter from W.W. Keith Asst. Surgeon 12th Regt. S.C.V. Mrs. P.T. Keith Anderson C.H. So. Ca.[End Page 4]"
