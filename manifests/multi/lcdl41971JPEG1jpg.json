      "value": "Washington County Dec 14th 1866 My very dear Brother The opportunity being so very favorable of sending a letter direct to you I cannot refrain from taking the advantage of it -- the bearer Miss Bessie Spann the eldest daughter of the Doctor you will scarcely recognize as the little girl you knew some ten of twelve years ago in Charleston at the request of her Grandmother & other relatives she decided recently to pay them a visit I need not tell you how happy I would be were it in my power to accompany her & enjoy so soon the pleasure of seeing those very dear to me, but it is necessary to live a while in anticipation. I received a letter a few days since from Sister Ellen written from Tuscaloosa telling me the good news that all at home were quite well, she was awaiting your arrival so I presume before this she is quietly settled in her own Convent, how I wish you could have given us a joyful surprise by extending your journey as far as \"Hidalgo Prairie\" -- you have been [illegible] to become such a \"bird of Passage\" that I do not despair yet of seeing you in Texas. I can almost fancy my dear brother that I have seen & spoken to you during the past month from conversing often with a young Clergyman who was first Sacristan during the Council in Baltimore Mr Eppingher he was not a priest then bur returned with our Bishop was ordained in Galveston, he spent three weeks here on account of our Pastor being sick we regretted much to see him leave he was so intelligent agreeable & exemplary as a Clergyman, his description of the proceedings of[End Page 1] the Council were most interesting it is something that will be spoken of in future ages, you seemed to have made quite an impression on Father Eppingher altho' you may not remember him among such an assemblage of Clergymen. I hope my dear Brother your untiring exertions on behalf of the diocese has met with a warm response & that it will not be a great while before the Cathedral will be seen in greater beauty than ever & other improvements also the Convent & \"Sisters\" must also require help, but there is little in our country to work with just now -- people seem to be very unsettled in all quarters, the Merchants it is said have over-reached themselves, planters are generally discouraged from the past years experience & leaving work for the next -- very many are renting out lands perfectly disgusted with trying to work the free negroes, among the number are Mr Spann's two Brothers. I believe they will both live in Galveston as for ourselves Mr Spann will try again this year & hope for the best. Conlaw will superintend the field closely & if the seasons are favorable I think we will have better success. I would be sorry to leave this place principally on account of our little church which has been a great consolation & happiness for us during many years, in good times & during the Confederacy we had a good congregation for the country, besides the whites there were about 30 communicants among the Negroes but since their freedom I am sorry to say that scarcely one remembers the Church -- were we to leave I am satisfied the Church would be removed as there is no other Catholic family in the neighborhood & this I would be grieved to think of so I live on the hope that the Negroes will come to their senses & that some Catholic families may settle near by our pastor probably will be removed to a village 9 or 10 miles from here where some Catholic families have settled & where they speak of building a church but he has promised us that anyhow[End Page 2] he will try to let us have the Holy Sacrifice offered up once a week which will be a great blessing & privilege. And now my dear Brother I will speak on a subject of importance we received from the Bishop through D.Spann your truly kind & generous offer relative to Conlaw. Mr Spann & I would be very glad to see him accept at once but something seems to hold him back, I do not know what all the Clergyman who see him, think he ought to have a vocation for that life considering his age & that he knows our desires I suppose it is better to leave the decision to himself as he has reflection & sense enough but is not very quick to act, he told me this morning that Father Bellaclas our Pastor whom Conlaw likes very much & to whom I believe he speaks freely had advised him to write to you & thank you for your kindness & also to ask you for a year to make a decision so my dear Brother you can form your own judgment of what is best. I do not despair yet having always had the thought for him but I commit the matters wholly to Almighty God whose honor & glory & the eternal happiness of Conlaw is all I have in view. In my last letter to Sister Ellen I spoke of our wish to send Caro to her Convent but seeing no opportunity of affecting this we sent her to Galveston now that this favorable occasion has offered we regret much that she is not here but perhaps it is all for the best & she may go later. You will probably be surprised to hear that Mrs Rice has joined a Religious order called the \"Sisters of Providence\" devoted to the care of orphans; such has been her intention for years but she could not take the step until she disposed of her daughters they are both married & a month since she received the habit & accompanied the Sisters to Austin where they have opened their new house. I hope dear brother amidst all your cares you are able occasionally to steal a few days to spend with Father & Mother[End Page 3] no doubt their greatest happiness is when you are with them. I am so thankful that they are blessed with such a fair share of health & trust it will long continue. Anna I hope accompanied you to Baltimore & enjoyed her visit to our good Sister Catherine. I will now conclude as I believe Mr Spann wishes to add a few lines hoping that I have not trespassed too much on your time recommending to your special care my favorite Bessie she became a convert about two years ago but I trust is strong enough in faith to resist the atmosphere with which she will be surrounded please give my love to all at home when you write & remember us in your prayers -- your affectionate Sister Mary Right Revd Sir Dear Brother As Mary leaves me room for a postscript I take advantage of it to address you a few lines in regard to your very kind proposition on behalf of Conlaw. As we have heard of it only in a general way, through a verbal message from our good Bishop of Texas will you be good enough when at leisure to address us a few lines in order that we may be more accurately posted on the subject. Conlaw, as well as ourselves, is truly grateful for the interest you take in his future welfare, and would, I have no doubt, be glad of an opportunity to advance himself in his studies, and he is not without the capacity to learn, if properly situated. Owing to bad seasons and the new character of our Labor System, I have been only partially successful in planting this year. But with better experience for the coming year, I am not discouraged from trying again, and hope with the blessing of God for more successful results. My motto is, \"Nil desperandum Dum spiro, spero.\" Present my kindest regards to all the family both in Cheraw and Columbia. Be pleased to remember me to all enquiring friends. I remain Right Revd & dear Sir very truly & respectfully M C Spann[End Page 4]"
