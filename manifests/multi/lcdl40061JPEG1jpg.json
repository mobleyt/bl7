      "value": "Beaufort Nov 18 1846 My Dear Brother, I hear you did not exactly apprehend my meaning. My earnest desire is that Spear, should he come to Charleston, may faithfully preach the doctrines of Grace--which Calvin did--and that he might do so as fully friendly and acceptably as possible. I expressed the hope that he would reject all [illegible] [illegible]. The only distinction I am willing to allow or assume is evangelical--for it is a scriptural distinction. I cannot concur that tho', upon the whole I agree with Calvin. I am bound to call myself or allow others to call me a Calvinist any more than to call myself or allow others to call me a [Paulite?] whose doctrines Calvin embraced. Indeed my total conviction is that if by such a course I put, what the Lord has not put, a stumbling block in the way of perishing souls, or [illegible] offence to a weak brother who is asking after [illegible] I shall truly be very guilty before God. The Lord has called me to preach the Gospel, and consequently what Paul taught and what, as I will assume, Calvin taught and Leighton & Thomas Scott, but he has not, that I can see, any where made[End Page 1] it binding on my conscience, to take or allow the name of Calvinist, Leightonite or Scottite --and not having done so, if I by assuming or confessing the name occasion injury or regard to souls, I violate, according to my convictions, the principle of the 14 chapter of Romans; Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died &c. However, my Dear Brother I did not sit down to argue. I merely wished to explain my meaning. My wish is that thro' my ministry & yours & brother Spear, The word of the Lord may have (unimpeded by any obstacles of our creation) free [illegible] & be glorified. [illegible]-- and he of will I must [illegible]--out of the truth as it is in Jesus & his name, the only one--and these we are not at liberty to get round or over, but not those arising out of the name or even the truth as it is in Calvin calling it after him or any other earthly Teacher. So in, as I trust, much humbleness of mind, I am constrained to think. I would not, I trust, get rid of necessary crosses--but I would as far as the Lord may enable me \"gather up the stones either way-- & lift up a standard for the people,\" bearing simply Jesus' name, with grace & glory unto it, and I leave the matter in question, with your conscience & mine, in view of what Jesus says \"offer as must come but won\" (?) and in view of what Paul says by the Spirit--\"Hast thou[End Page 2] faith? [Illegible] it to thyself before God. Happy is that illegible] not himself in that thing which he [illegible]. Yours affectionately in the one glorious hope Jos R. Walker Please keep this Show it to Brother Spear Did you ever read Simeon's preface to his Horae Homileticae? I should like you to read it.[End Page 3] Rev. J.R. Walker Nov. 1846 For The Rev.
