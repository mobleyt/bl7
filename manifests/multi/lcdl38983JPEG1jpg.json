      "value": "25   Mrs. Nathl. Heyward   Charleston   South Carolina   Care of Messrs. Dart & Spears [End Page 1] Philadelphia Sepr. 15th   Four days ago my dear Mother I wrote a long letter to my Father in answer to one I received from him upon my arrival here. it was confined principally to my affairs at Combahee. and little attention made of our proceedings since leaving N. York. Our visit to Black point was attended with a great deal of pleasure, tho' the journey was very uncomfortable, on account of the badness of the roads, and an excessively hard carriage which was the only one we could procure, in the little Village we landed at in the Jerseys- the country thro' which we travelled was as poor and barren as the worst of our pine lands and the road was composed of heavy deep sand and loose stones, so that what with the carriage and the road, Susan was made very sick and alarmed me considerably- however, with great care and attention at Mr Smiths, she completely recovered- Our stay at B. P. extended to a week, Mrs. Izard was staying there and Morgan Gibbes joined us the day after our arrival- I had never seen Mr. Smith until I met him a few weeks previous in N. York, and we met there as if we had been acquainted all of our lives. I have not spent such a pleasant week for a long time the house is large and spacious nicely furnished. and the situation beautiful being situated upon a hill, which overlooks most all of the surrounding country, and at the same time has a commanding view  [End Page 2] of the sea, and all the shipping going and coming in and out of N. York, the only objection to the place is the difficulty of getting to and from it. Mr. Smith has very much improved it, he hired it for twelve years, eight of which have elapsed, therefore his improvements will now stop. the house being large and well furnished, it is his delight to have company but the inconvenience as I stated above, of reaching him has prevented a great many from partaking of his hospitality who otherwise would have been exceeding glad to have done so-Joseph Bonaparte and his suit and my Aunt Manigault left him a few days prior to our arrival I regretted this as I should liked very much to have seen the brother of my acquaintance, Nap. Upon our leaving B. point, Mr. S. was kind enough to lend us his barouche which was very easy and comfortable, so that our journey altho' very dusty and sandy yet was not as fatiguing as the other to Susan, we came to Bordentown, situated upon the Delaware about thirty miles from Philadelphia here Genl. Izard and his family spend the summer, we dined with them one day and would have passed a very pleasant time but the Genl. was taken very sick in the morning and confined to his bed the whole day, but Mrs. Izard his wife, did the honors of his house charmingly-The next morning we took the steam boat as she came along on her way to Philda. from Trenton, we breakfasted on board and  [End Page 3] arrived in Philada. about twelve oclock- our lodging which we had engaged in the same house, with Ben Huger and his wife was not prepared so we are now in others near by, until they are ready, which will be I presume on Tuesday next-we shall be very comfortably there, our lodging and board cheap-Susan's chamber I shall make very comfortable by a few additions of my own-We are only two squares from my Aunt,-- Susan is in excellent health and I have every hope she will do well-She joins me in affectionate love to all,--   What a melancholy summer it appears you have had in Chaston.- owing to that horrid disease, the [page torn- Yellow?] fever, but the worst of all is its attacking [illegible] I presume Hetty and Nat can't be very calm,-- Beaufort I am told is also unhealthy-have you heard anything concerning the health of the inhabitants in my late pine barren residence? for if that proves sickly there is no faith in any of them,-- I think you will find Ann very much improved when she returns, she is much more easy in her manners,-- her complexion much clearer and she is become more fashionable. She is on a visit to Mrs. Smith with her husband- Joseph is in Boston, he will be here soon I suppose   With the hope of hearing soon from you   I am my dear Mother your   Affect. Son Wm Ml [?] Heyward.  [End Page 4]"
