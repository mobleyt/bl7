      "value": "Columbia So Ca Oct 29th 1849 My Dear Aunt I have been away now one month and it was time ere this for me to have written you. I have kept up however such a rapid correspondence with Mamma & the children, that it seemed as if I had exhausted all my writing energies already & it would be waste of time & paper to continue. I cannot do so however until I have written you one letter at least. I must confess that I was taken some what aback with the news of a wedding in the family, but could scarcely have guessed that it was the Patriarch of the flock that was about to lend his neck to the marriage yoke. I know that it has been your expectation for some time, but to you it must occasion some surprise. On Aunt Martha's account I am sorry -- she has been so devoted to the children & so jealous of Grand fathers affection & care, that she cannot but feel distressed. Aunt Meta, is so accommodating to his views & has such implicit faith in him, that she can scarcely withhold [rejoicing?] with his joy. And the lady[End Page 1] stands very high in her estimation. The wedding is to come off on Christmas Eve, I hear. If true I suppose I may be at it -- to greet my [illegible] Gd mother. Uncle Osborn & Aunt Jean [will?] [receive?] their sister as their mother! Quite a novel relation. I would just as have Gd father marry Miss Richardson however as any one else. I believe she is a very fine person, very accomplished, intelligent & [illegible] her physiognomy quite agreeable. So much for the wedding news. All with me here at Columbia goes on smoothly. I was surprised two evenings ago with an invitation to where do you think? It puzzles me to know the why a wherefore -- to a wedding party. Dr. Allen Green had married Miss Sally Scott -- the adopted daughter of Mr & Mrs Clark -- and sent me the invite to the wedding party. I could not imagine how it could be & therefore dressed up & went round to Mrs Izards to find out the truth & nature of the invite. It was genuine & all OK so that in an hour after I was [illegible] my way in company with 3 pretty girls -- to a wedding party. I passed a very pleasant time, ate a [host?] of sweet things & am only condemned to pay a formal visit in [lieu?] for my [illegible]. I believe Mrs Izard is at the bottom of the invite, but I know Miss Scott very slightly and but little[End Page 2] better acquainted with Mr Clark. This is the only pleasure party I have indulged in & intend keeping very close for the session at least -- as study & fun do not go hand in hand together. I suppose Aunt Hetty will be passing through Columbia shortly. I shall be on the look out & endeavor to see her -- they generally stay here one day & let me know of their arrival so that it is highly probable that I shall do so. I hope all are well at home. I have not heard for some time, but suppose if there had been sickness -- they would have written. The existence of the yellow fever makes me somewhat anxious but as I have not heard of the attack upon [illegible] or citizens -- I feel comparatively at ease. Do remember me kindly to Cousin [illegible] & accept my dear aunt the many cares & much love of your affectionate Nephew R W Barnwell[End Page 3] Mrs. Martha Ann Mathews Charleston South Carolina[End Page 4]"
