      "value": "But at the same time, other plans have suggested themselves, & I am disposed to try them also. But mean time I thought you ought to have an answer & I wished to be distinctly informed, not only as to the question which I have already referred to, but also further, in regard to the point of time, when my services would be required in Charleston, if the arrangements were made. Let me understand these points, & I will do what can be done quickly. I confess I should give up the [illegible] with less regret, because I find on experiment that it is scarcely possible to perform my duty in it, with acceptance to its patrons. Many of them will not bear what I believe to be sound doctrine, on some important points, & one object which I should wish to accomplish in C-- would be the publication of a really honest & independent press, which the really moderate & Calvinistic of our brethren are ready to patronise. I need scarcely add, that it would be very pleasant to renew our inter-- [End Page 1] course with your own family & many other beloved friends, the want of whose [illegible] kindness, we have always felt. But still more, I should rejoice to be enabled to renew the labor of love, which was there begun, & help to strengthen the things that remain. I am not in-- --deed sanguine of much success, in the enforcement of obnoxious truth, especially in these days; but still I should account it a peculiar privilege, to be permitted to bear my testimony in its behalf whether men would hear or whether they would [forbear?]. I trust that the Lord will make his way plain before my face. Your affectionate fr & bro W.W. Spear Rev. W.W. Spear Sept 18 1846 Forwarded to me at Flat Rock & recd Oct 7th 1846 Rev W. H. Barnwell Charleston So. Carolina (crossed out) Flat Rock, North Ca. [End Page 2]"
