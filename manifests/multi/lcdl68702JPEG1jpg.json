      "value": "COPY\nWednesday, Oct 11 th. 1944.\nLt.Comdr.J.M.Legendre,USNR.\nBox 166, Commandant,\nNavy [number] 128, FPO San Francisco.\nDear Morris-\nWhere are you and Sid now ? I wrote you an air-mail\nletter form around here on Sept 24. I haven't received a reply , so\nimagine that it arrived after you had left for the mainland on your \nexpected \"leave\".If so , and if this reaches you while you are in\nWashington , I think that perhaps you can be of some help to me,\nand thats the reason for this letter. I'm sending it to your usual\naddress at Navy [number]128 with a request on the envelope that it please \nbe \"forwarded’ , so trust it reaches you.\nI have just received an answer to my request for inactive duty.\nThe answer is \"no\" , and enclosed is copy of the Bureaus letter. You\nwill not that it is dated Sept 9 th and was a month in transit , \ncoming via regular mail--- they couldnt even waste an air-mail stamp\non it ! I dont believe that my request received much consideration.\nWhilst my request[ copy of which I enclose together with copy of Capt\nHuntoons endoresement] is dated Aug 25 , it was nto mailed from Seattle\nuntil the 28 th. It probably arrived in the Bureau a few days later,\nand the fact that it was then answered on Sept 9 th leads me to believe\nthat it received purely \"routine\" treatment. It is signed by a Lt.Comdr.\nmerely signed the letter. I would therefore like to pursue the matter\nfurther untill I'm convinced that some really responsible person has \ndecided ont he merits of the case. Each letter from Olive brings me\nnews of someone being released, and I believe my case more \"worthy\"\nthan many.\nSo, if you are in Washington when this reaches you, I wonder\nif you would see hat you can do to help bring my case to the attention\nof the \"big shot\". The enclosed copy of my request gives you my picture\nin brief, but I think I had better give you a fuller explanation of\nit , so that if you get in an \"argument\" about the relative merits of\nmy case as compared to others, you will have some ammunition.\nMy main argument is that my family needs me more than the Navy.\nThe money angle is the important one. In my request in paragraphs\n[b]xxxx [c] and [d] , I state that in 1941 and 1942 I paid good-sized\nincome taxes, and since then have paid nothing. This may astonish you\nand you may wonder what happened to the money I got from selling out\nmy share in Zander Co. What happened was this :\nSeveral years ago , a firm in Cincinnati went broke in a big\nway. We had such big contracts with them that it resulted in busting\nour firm in Santos and practically busting the one in New Orleans.\nI borrowed to the hilt against the house, life insurance policies\netc. We struggled along for a few years without any improvement until\n[End Page 1]\nabout four years ago we bought out Bartlett and I got controlling\ninterest in the firm. I instituted reforms and then, partly from that\nand partly from just plain luck , we made good money--[dollar sign]91,000 my last\nyear if I recall correctly. Then the war xxx came and when I got on\nthat carrier, I figured my chances were about 50-50 and I had best\nput my affairs in order and I sold out to Leo. After paying big income\ntaxes, and paying off all the loans on the house, life-insurance etc,\nthere was mighty little left. We have had to live mostly on our capitol\nsince I got in the Navy , so that now we have less than [dollar sign]30,000 left,\nand that doesnt bring much interest when invested in bonds--both War\nBonds and others. So I think you can see----- and I hope you can convince\nthe guy in Bupers you talk to ! --- that a few more years of this will\njust about make me a Social Security problem for our Govt.\nIf I am released now , there is a swell job waiting for me. As I\npreviously wrote you, Leo doesn't want to hook up with me again due to\nthe small coffee quota allowed him by the OPA, and I cant enter business\nfor myself due to OPA rulings , but I have a proposition form an old\nestablished firm. They are one of the biggest and best in the world,\nwith offices in New York, San Fancisco, Chicago and all over Central\nand South America. They have no office in New Orleans and want me to\nopen and run one there. They not only handle coffee but many other\nitems for both import and export. The Name is Otis McAllister Co.,\nI give you this in confidence , only to be used if necessary. On no\naccount mention this otherwise please as for many reasons we wish it\nkept secret untill the time arrives when I can get going. Naturally,\nthis proposition wont be kept open indefinitely. Since our Govt is\nvery partial as a \"Good Neighbor\" to our Central and South American\nfriends , here is the chance to release me to further foster that\nspirit. I would not be merely xxxx supplanting someone already in New \nOrleans , as this firm is not represented there at present, so I would\nbe building new contacts with Latin America.\nA very important point to bring out is that I am in an \" in\ntraining\" status on this ship. This is bxxx brought out in Capt Huntoons\nendorsement, copy of which is enclosed. Once I am made officially the \nExec of the Castor , I fear it will be just that much more difficult\nto get released. So far the Capt has agreed to my request to leave me \nin an \"intraining\" status , but I fear that soon this will end. That is\nwhy I would like to bring this to a head quickly while I'm still in\nthis status.\nWell---I guess that just about covers my \"arguments\".\nPossibly you are wondering why I dont wait untill my own return\nto the US to handle this myself. Unfortunately, the date of our return\nis very indefinite. Latest rumours are that we will re-load from one \nof the bases out in this area , so as to save time in that long trip\n[End Page 2]\nback to the US. Most certainly, there is no chance of our being back\nthere for a couple of months anyway. And I sure dont want to let this\nthing die in the meantime , so thats why I'm bothering you. Hope you\ndont mind too much !\nIf you arent able to accomplish anything , my next recourse is to \nenlist the aid of one of our Louisiana Senators, Ellender. He is no\nbuddy of mine , but some of my friends such as Leon Irwin are fairly\nclose to him. He is on the Naval Affairs Commitee , so if he wants to,\nI imagine he could help. It would be my intention to have Olive see\nhim herself [ if he is in New Orleans ] or xxxxx else contact him\nthrough a friend. But I would only want to do this as a last resort\nas I detest getting mixed up with politicians. I am writing Olive by\nthis same mail, so she has all the dope. Would you mind either writing\nher or phoning her [ Uptown 4396 ] , telling her what results that you\nwere able to obtain , so that she will then know how to proceed.\nIf I dont have any luck either through you or Ellender, then I\nguess I'll just have to wait untill that long expected xxxxxx Alnav\ncomes out about men over 38 , and then I can re-submit my request.\nHave you heard anything more about that Alnav ? I continue to hear\nroumours that \"it will be out shortly\", but this would surely be at\nvariance with recent statment of Sec Forrestall's that no one would\nbe released from the Navy.\nHave you and Sidney decided yet as to whether or not you want \nto get out ? Most assuredly plenty of men are doing it every day---\nprobably by special pull , but they sure as hell are getting out ,\nso if others are getting out , I'll be dammed if I see why we should\nbe the goats.\nWell , this thing is plenty long-winded , so will say so long\nand amny thanks in advance for anything you can do. Please drop me a \nline air-mail and let me know whats what. Oh Yes-- tell Jo-Jo hello\nfor me !\nLt.Comdr.A.Legendre,USNR.\nUSS Castor [AKS-1]\nc o FPO, San Francisco, Cal.\n[End Page 3]"
