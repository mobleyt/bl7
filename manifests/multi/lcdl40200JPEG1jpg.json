      "value": "Beaufort Sept. 1st, 1830 I have been intending to write you my dear Catherine for so long a time, that I will defer it no longer; although today, I feel rather sad and probably my letter will be tinged with these feelings; but when you are told the cause, I am sure you will participate with me in them. Wm Elliots son Wm died this morning at four O'Clock, most unexpectedly to us, and I fear to his family also; he was taken the last Wednesday with fever, the type of which Dr. Fuller did seem certain, but although it was high and continued I do not think from what I understood he felt [apprehensive?] for his life. We saw Cousin [M?] Elliott Monday evening and she told us that she had been up with him the night before, but that he was much better that day, she did not seem by any means uneasy, the servants tell us that they thought him better until four o'Clock yesterday afternoon but we have heard nothing from any one else: his poor Mother I feel so much for her she is devoted to her children, and this child the family had told me not very long since was so much to her; dear Catherine this is a dying world, we turn to the right to the left, and death, death resounds in our ears, and yet how much do we all live as if this was an abiding City, as if to us it would not be [soon?] that we must go; My Aunt received a letter from Cousin Mary by the last Mail, and her accounts of Elizabeth are such, that it would not surprise me in the least if before long we should learn, that she has taken her departure; they are still moving about, but Elizabeth cannot walk herself, but is taken in[End Page 1] in a chair and put into the carriage, she is not able to sit up without her head being supported, has chills and fever almost every day; [Mr. Pnc?] has not yet reached her, and [as she?] does not know he is going on, not hearing from him adds to her trouble; Cousin Mary seems almost [ran?] out, Mr [illegible] took cold at [Saratoga?] as has been sick again; they have now gone on to [Weathers?] Field; this is a sad account dear Catherine, that it might make us all remember the [ends?]. Netty received your letter by your Father we are happy to hear you are all well, the children Robert, [illegible] very much improved. we have about a dollar & three quarters belonging to [Bet?], suppose you [let him?] make a pouch for my sister and [illegible] [send to charge?] for a price of [illegible], with this money to put round it, propose it to her and see if she would [not?] like to do it, I do not hesitate [pertaining?] it to you and [hope?] you would wish [her] to pay my sister every attention. I wish you were here to attend the Bible Class with Netty, she seems quite pleased, it is quite a [Congress?]. I am sorry Mr. [George?] preaches so little to your satisfaction, I always felt [upon?] that his preaching was not what it ought to be. I am thankful that the preacher you listen to is so much what you wish; I would be better pleased I acknowledge if he was of a Church that you could connect yourself with without excluding you from all others; it would be a great comfort to have you [Minister?] your [pastor?]; this I [fear?] will never be the case with Mr. [Wyan?] to either William or yourself, for I do not deny it would give me great pain should either of you become members of a Church who consider all those but themselves as walking in another path, I trust it is not merely [sectarian?] feelings that causes me to think [illegible] it is ungodly [not?] my Church [that?] makes my [objection?] so strong, for it seems to make a [partition wall?] between the dearest friends, and some have lately found it so, you would not formerly believe it [in?] him I said so. There they are to become[End Page 2] [lost?] of secondary [importance?], [but?] they affect our comfort not a little [nevertheless?] and until this mortal has put on immortality, I cannot see [but?] that it must give us pain to know that those we love [inside?] us [are living?] in [open neglect?], of what is it [seen?] is their opinion the most important command of our Saviour: I think one of these days I will get [illegible] sermons on that subject and send you, as I think it very desirable that every man should be fully persuaded in his own mind. We are all quite well, and the town still continues healthy, this our most sickly month, but I trust I should be able to possess my soul in patience whatever is to be the event. My sister is rather better but by no means well. I have not [seen?] Bower since her return from Bay-Point excepting at Church she still looks badly. My Aunts family are well, I suppose your Father mentioned to you that he was to take her to [Charleston?] in his boat the next week; she really has [illegible] upon [illegible]. Little Lila is quite well and a great amusement to us, she is [illegible] very intelligent, but it appears as if every body thinks their child is the most so, for I am told [Bower?] think hers much [more?] so than Lila. Kiss Elizabeth for me, tell her I hope she will improve every day. We have not heard from Mary very lately they were then quite well, fortunately the Storm did very little injury in Georgia, I do not [page torn] what would become of them if their [crop was?] destroyed. [Pray remember?] [page torn] affectionately to William I will write to him before long and [page torn] me dear Catherine to be your affectionate sister A Barnwell[End Page 3] [center of page] Beaufort So Co[South Carolina] 1 Sept, 3 Mrs. William H.
