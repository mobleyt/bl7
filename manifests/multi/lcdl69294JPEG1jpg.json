      "value": "November 1, 1932\nGertie Darling,\nHere I am on my birthday night down at the office\nmaking this typewriter fly in order that I may tell you how much\nI love you and missed you on my birXthday. I felt I could take you\nin my arms as we talked over the phone, andI could see your sweet\nbrown eyes, and your hair curling around your ears. I know how\nlovely you looked and it gave me the most tremendous desire to take\nyou by the hand and lead youup to our room. It is so long sincel\nI have seen and kissed youthat it seems an eternity. But it will all\nbe over soon and then we can make up for everything we have missed.\nLast night we went to Kanaoe . There is the most\nattracetive club there. Absolutely sweet. A tiny frame building\nbuilt in the simplies_t manner possible. Two sides are all sliding\nglass doors and one of these doors open out onto a swimming pool.\nThe other opens onto a tennis court which is sorrounded by cocanut\npalms, and flowering habicus. There is the most attractive bar\nby the swimming pool. Nothing is served there except ice water,\nbut it is so cunning that I loved it. We played tennis and then\nmetered to the BOQ at the air field for dinner. The food w s very\ngood and it was served by negroes that were so blacked and loose\njointed that I felt the[y] had just come off theplantation. We\nhad baked ham and yams and ice tea, and I ate so much that my sides\nswelled out like a ballons. Afterwards we motored back over the\nPali, which is a most terrifying experience in the blackout and\nwere in bed by ten clock. This morning , my birthday morning I\n[End Page 1]\nawoke quite early[,] asper habit and read , delighted that I did not\nhave toget up and go to work. At eight I ordered the most enormous\nbreakfast sent to our rooms, read the morningpaper and then your\ncall came through. For half [A]n hour[,] after talking to you I did\nnot make much sense, just sort of wandered around the room puttering\nwith cleaning shoes looking at your picture, cleaning shoes again\nuntil finally I pulled myself out of the daze ard kicked Morris out\nof bed. We then got Teddy Burrell and a boy called Pick Butler one\nplayed doubles. It was great fun , they were to good for us[,] and\nyouth told, so we went down to defeat. I then lay on the beach for\nan hour during which I slipped into the water a couple of times.\nHowever the Water was no t very good because it was filled with\nbig globs of oil that touched and stuck so that at the end I looked\nlikea negro and had a hell of a time getting it off. Thebeach was\nfollowed by a big lunch and a rest on our porch during which I\nread the account of the sinking of the wasp by the men cn board.\nI know you have read it so will not send it to you. without a\ndoubt it is the most terryfying discription of men going to their\ndeath in the sheeet of fire that engulfed the ship that I have ever\nread. The poor fellows that were trapped below andthe men who\nlost their lives trying to rescue them nade one realize how brave\nthose sailors and officers were.\nAfterwards we played tennis again and then dressed\nand came to the yard with the idea of having dinner at the BOQ.\nWhat was our dismay on arriving there to find a sign saying [\"] we\nhave adopted the principle that after xxx two hundred and fifty\nmen have been served the dinning room will be closed.[\"] So now\nI am at the office dinnerless and hungry as hell. Bet I will eat\n[End Page 2]\nenough breakfast to send that place into bankruptcy. I am already\nthinking ofthe scrambled eggs and hot cakes. WE came here to night[,]\nbecause we find that after sunday[,] monday has such an accumalation of\nwork that it is better to come down Sunday night and work for\na couple of hours in order to lessen the londay morning rush.\nI received a cable from you this evening wishing me\na happy birthday and saying you were telehoning me at 9AM . Of \ncourse that was the telephone call of this xxxx morning. I however\nhad had previous experience with these calls and had called the\noperator of overseas calls on Saturday and toldher I wasexpecting\na call and to let me know that evening tu the latest nt what time\nI might expect it.\n[T]he last letter I received from you was that of\nthe thirteenthX of October. I think there has been some delay on\nthe mainl,and because all the men have had the same trouble and\nmany of them say they are going to marry stenographers before the\nnext war in o[r]der that they may be sure of getting letters.\nSammy Trincher tele[P]honed Morris yesterday saying that\nhe was being drafted but Pearl would run the theatres in\nconjunction with MucK. It would be very funny if those two girls \nran it hotter than the men. No one would dare to lift their heads\nagain. I am afraid however they are not hard boiled enough to do\nthe bargaining for pictures or fight the jews at all the little\ntricks of the trade. It would really be a shame if some kike\nstopped in and got all the good pictures from Morris while he is at\nwar.\nHave not heard a word from Armsnt so figure he has passed\nus by and is [\"]down under[\"] All my love.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 3]"
