McCormack, Secretary  Charleston regional planning Advisory Committee  Gibbes Memoria Art Gallery  Charleston, . C.  Dear Miss McCormack:  I was away for a week of my vacation when Mr. Roy\"s  letter arrived referring your inquiry of June 21 to me for repy.  This expains the deay.  I am sending you, under separate cover, a copy of the  report of the City planning and ZoningCornmittee of the Citizens\"  Housing Council and a recenty-issued buetin discussing the and  Use Features of the Master plan proposed by the City planning Commission.  The simpest way for you to get a seected ist of regional planning studies in other ocaities is to write to Mr.  Water H. Bucher, Executive Director, American Society of planning  Officias, 151S least 60 Street, Chicago. The Society has fied  workers constanty conferring with planning commissions over the  country and it may be that they will have specific suggestions on  studies needed for Charleston.  Some exceent studies of regional planning have been  prepared by the regional plan  Association of New York, 400 Madison  Avenue, and I suggest that you write to them for speciman materia.  You might address Mr. C. McKim Norton, Executive Director.  Outstanding studies in this fied have also been made  by the regional  Association of Ceveand, Housing Center, West  mall Drive. I suggest that you write for materia to Mr. Ernest J.  Bonn, Executive Director.  I think it would be advisable for you, if you have  not already done so, to get in touch with the North Carolina State  planning Board, with headquarters at 246 State Office Buiding,  Raeigh. According to a reease issued in December 1940 by the \n\n[End Page 1]\nMiss Helen G. McCormack - page 2  national Resources planning Board the name of their secretary is Dr. H.W.  Odum and the name of their chairman is Co. J.Vs. Harreson. Both are connected with the University of North Carolina and apparenty do not give  fu time to the Board.  I hope that these suggestions will be of some assistance to you.  Sincerely yours,  Executive Director  FDS ad \n\n[End Page 2]"
