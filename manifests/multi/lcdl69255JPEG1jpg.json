      "value": "11 \n March 11, 1945,\nGertle Darling,\nWhat a letter that was, your No 74 of March\n1st. It arrived this morning two days after your letter\nof March 3rd. and completely bowled me over. I have read it\nover about twenty times and can only come to the conclusion\nthat you were terribly tired and nervous when youwrote it.\nLet us take up some of the things you say in\nthe order that they were written. First yousay that I was in\na hurry to ring off. I was not in a hurry to ring off but\ntold you goodbye because I could not hear anything you were\nsaying. As I stated in a last letter everytime I started to\ntell youabout the swimming and surfboarding that morning\nyou would say \"are you in the water\" or something like that.\nIn the end I thought it must hold some meaning and was some\nform of code and told you that I did not understand what it\nwas about. During the entire coversation your voice would\nfade sway and I would hear nbthing and then suddenly lt would\ncome back after a while and you would be talking about something\nof which I had missed half the point. You know how I really\ndislike the phone and then on top of that to be unable to say\nvery much without the censor cutting us off makes a normal\nconversation impossible. Frankly I get much more out of\nyour letters than the phone.\nSecondly you say you do not care how terrible\nTozzer is, all that you want to be is out here. I realize\nyou want to be out here because I want to be with youdear,\nand I have tried to get youout here but with no results.\nWhen I asked my captain he said , if you will tell me how\nto get my wife out. Colonel Laswell of the Marines who I\nthought might know saldhe had been trying to get his wife out\nfor eight months. There are three boys in the office that\n,have done everything they can and have now given up hope. You\nhave been told these things by me before but apparently do not\nbelieve them. There are thousands of men in the service out\nhere that want their wives out just as I want mine but this\nis the Navy. You are a civilian and cannot realize how free\nyou are and how we are held up by directives and orders. If\nyou_want to qultoyou can quit now, the best I can hope for is\nsix months after the end of the war. But there is absolutley\nno use my going into this again. I have done it in so many lett\ners. I really tried to explain; to you that the Navy does not\nwant any wives out,that there is nothing that I can do, but\nyou interprett it as my not loving youany more. How can you\n[End Page 1]\nsay such a thing dear, how can youhave so little faith. Just \nthink how you would feel if I wrote youand said \"you do not\nlove me anymore\" when you lovemeso much . I think it would \nmake you feel very sad to know your love was doubted that the\nperson you cared for did not have sufficent faith in you to\nbelieve you could continue loving them although you were\nseperatred because of a war. I do not know what our past life\nhas meant to you Gertie. In everyway I have tried to do the\nthing that would please you, I tried to hunt on those dam horses\nI gave up all ideas of business, I went on expeditions, we\ntoured Europe in Motor cars until I thought my back would break\ng and I was so happy to do it because those thlngs pleased you.\nNow because our country is at war and I am trying to do my best\nout here, and have been unable to get you out you say I do\nnot love you. It is all beyond me and I seriously Wonder who\nI have been married to, is it some one who is so selfish that\nshe upbraids me the first timesI cannot accede to her wish\nbecause it is beyond my power.\nGertie I have told youhow I have missed you in any\nnumber of letters. How I wished you were with me swimming\nwalking ln the moonlight lying by my side in the evening. But\nI if I had not, what difference. You ought to know without\nconstant repepetition that I love and adore you and you should\nfeel sure enough of me not to need continual assurance on my\npart that I love you. If you don't Gertie then you miss one\nof the great things in life. There is no doubt in my mind \nabout you, all the people in the world could talk against you,\nI could go without hearing from you for ten years but at the\nend I would still love and feel you loved me. \nI wanted to yarn you about Toozer. To let you\nknow what youwere getting yourself in for so that you could\ntry to get out some other way without comprising yourself.\nYesterday we received an order that we were no longer to give\nOSS any further information, so youcan see that he is non\npersona grata. You took this warning as a sign on my part\nthat I did not want you here. I am so sorry that you could\nshave thought that [my] love for you has failed. It is the one\nstrong thing in my life, the one thing I have clung to and\nfrom your letter I gather it hasn't been very impressive.\nNevertheless you still have it sweetheart.\nSidney\n[End Page 2]"
