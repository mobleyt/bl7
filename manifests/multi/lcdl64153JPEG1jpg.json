      "value": "[Stephen Drayton to Benjamin Lincoln\nJanuary 18, 1779\n[RvW Box 1 Folder 24; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\nCharles Town [Charleston] 18th.. January 1779\nSir\nLate on yesterday I had the honor of your letter\nof the 12th Instant from Purysburgh. I am glad you mean to\norder some of the Waggons [sic] from Camp as we are really puzzled \nto procure a sufficiency. –\nI beg leave before I quit this head to mention to you\nSir, the impropriety of the Commissary of North Carolina's\nconduct, in having authority to get Waggons without my\nknowledge – Consequently I have several times been imposed\nupon by the subterfuge of No Carolina Service, the authority\nhe acts under is his appointment of Commissary – which in his\nState gave him ample power, but I humbly conceive can in\nnoway operate here - [and] even there, it must have militated\nwith order. -\nWilling, Sir, to render every Service to my Country I can,\nForgive me, if I mention to you difficulties or improprieties that\nI may meet with; hitherto, [and] for very good reasons, matters in\nmy Department have been carryed [sic] on without any regularity\n- hence arises the many difficulties [and] the continuation of Im-\n-proprieties – to lay them before you, is to remove them – In this\nopinion therefore I conceive it my Duty to acquaint you of every\nmode that may strike me, by which we can with more celerity \n[and] can convey Stores [and] other essentials to Camp.\nwith\n[End Page 1]\nwith deference sir, let me then recommend a proper\nconvoy of Batteans [sic], to go from hence to Combahe [Combahee] or as circum\n-stances may render it necessary to Ashepo [Ashepoo] – In doing this I\nwould humbly propose to get a couple of Boats on whom can\nbe mounted two 6 pounders in prow, a few swivels, with \n15 or 20 men each, [[and] those Militia] – such Boats can with\ncare be had, as Convoys, - in one fleet we can transport as\nmuch provisions [and] other Stores as 150 or 200 Waggons could take\nin – then please consider the Land carriage is Short'ned near\ntwo thirds, [and] that two thirds some of the worst Roads. Ten\nBatteans containing 70 or 80 bls. of Beef, pork or flour [and]\nnavigated from 4 to 6 hands can make a trip to [and] from\neither of those places once in ten days upon an Average.\nTo sett aside the difference of Expence [sic], it would be the\nmeans of having your Army while at their present Port, better\n[and] more regularly Supplyed [sic] – from what I have said you \ncan form a judgement [sic] – therefore will not intrude more upon\nyour time.\nI have supplyed Genl. [General] Ash with a few Tents [and] knap-\n-sacks, the former a few indeed – as I cannot obtain an Exem\n-ption from Militia Duty for those so necessarily engaged in pub\n-lic work – for want of wire I cannot send on any Kettles –\nbut\n[End Page 2]\nbut in a few days shall send a large supply of Canteens - [and] my\nutmost shall be exected [executed] to procure some Iron Rods to be drawn\nfor compleating [sic] the Kettles - spades or shovels it is in vain to hope \nfor the President denies he has any, [and] not one to be bought, the\nPresident recommends pressing them from plantations. –\nHoes, axes, [and] a few grubbing hoes I now forward – the Carpenters Tools\nI shall dispatch immediately it is but within these few days I could\nobtain many of the articles.\nAs to Carpenters I fear sir, there will be a difficulty\nattending the procuring of them – never the less I will stride to\nbring a company on with me.\nI take Liberty to inclose [sic] a list of Articles now come\non – and have the Honor to be\nSir,\nwith the greatest Esteem\nYour most Obedient\nHumble servant\nStep: [Stephen] Drayton\n[ink blot]\n[End Page 3]\n[Addressed:]  On Public Service\nThe Honble [Honorable]\nMajor Genl. [General] Lincoln\nCommander in Chief of the\nSothern Department\nCamp at Purysburg\n[Endorsed:] From Co. [Colonel] Drayton\nJan.y [January] 18.1779\n[seal]\n[End Page 4]"
