      "value": "Charleston, S, C.  The Face of a City  For its size, Charleston probably enjoys  greater fame than any American city that  comes to mind. The national Publicity it  gets as a place of beauty and antiquity  sometimes astonishes even the Charleston-  ians, who never have been known for modesty about the virtues of their city. They  do not mind criticizing themseves, but woe  betide the unwary stranger who sings a  brickbat at the haowed ground between  the  Ashley  and  the  Cooper.  with that attitude The News and Courier,  a dweer in these parts since 1803, entirey  agrees.  For the information of us Charesonians,  there is an interesting dispay now on view  to the Public at the Gibbes Art Gallery.  Using the modern technique of visua education, this dispay of pictures and the  written word points up in a spectacuar  manner some of the good points and some  ,bi the bad ones of the physica. aspect of  Charleston.  4- Fine old buildings and narrow, picturesque streets that tourists come miles  to see are shown, and also squaid sums,  crowded tenements, fire and health hazards.  The pictures show architectvra achievements that are the pride of America, and  the addition of gimcracks that spoi natura  .vaues.  This show was arranged by the Charleston Civic Services Committee of the Carolina Art associaltion. The committee operated under a Carnegie corporation grant,  and a survey began in January, 1941. Miss  Helen G. McCormack, a Charlestonian who  has come back home after a notable career  in management of art institutions in Richmond, is the secretary of this committee.  She gathered the photographs-took many  of them hersef-and the facts to go with  them. The resut, is an achievement that  should interest every Charlestonian, from  the \"od resident\" whose ancestors came  over with the first setters, to the new ones  who moved in this week to work on .defense projects.  Here is food for thought, here are answers  to questions of newcomers, here are unpeasant facts that will offend civic pride  and pleasant ones that make the chest  swe. Here is a heritage and here is a  chaenge.  The last plane on the dispay is an iuminated sign that asks, \"Who is responsibe?\"  As the ight fashes off it shows a mirror,  in which the citizen sees himsef.  At the risk of antagonizing the Public that  suspects offers of \"something for nothing\",  The News and Courier points out that this  show is free. That is, it is free of cost in  money. It will not be free of menta effort.  Anyone who caims to think should not miss  this opportunity.        ADD  1  fill   192"
