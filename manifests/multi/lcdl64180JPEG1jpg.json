      "value": "[John Mathews to Nathanael Greene\nNovember 30, 1781\n[RvW Box 2 Folder 51; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\n[Endorsed:]  From Mr. Mathews\nNov.r [November] 30th 1781.\t\t\nPhiladelphia Nov.r 30th.1781\nDear Sir/\t\t\n[Endorsed continued:] Uti possidetis\nWas assured that after\nthe Reduction of So.C.\nCharles town wd be besieged\nMrs. G. accounting\nI had the pleasure of receiving yours\nof the 26th Ulto. by the last express.\nWe are under great anxiety here to\nknow whether any [and] what reinforcement\nwent with the British fleet from New York\nto Chs.town. They have never kept any of\ntheir transactions so profound a secret as\nthis. Should any considerable force be sent\nto Chs.town; notwithstanding the reinfor-\n-cement sent you, I dont see, that your si-\n-tuation will be the least bettered. Unless\nVirginia and North Carolina will make those\nexertions they ought to. Much depends my\nD.r Sir. on your situation by the month of\nMarch. Should the Dutch continue firm [and]\nact with vigour in the war – which all our\nlate accounts from that quarter give us the\nstrongest reason to believe they will – Britain\nmust at all events negotiate; how\nfar they may be seriously disposed for peace,\nmay be a question; how far they may be ad-\n-mitted to play a fast [and] loose game, will in\na great measure depend on the situation\nof their affairs in America. I have observed \n[End Page 1]\nbefore, Britain has given up every Idea of\nconquering the Northern states; her sole\ndependance [sic] for concluding the war any ways\nadvantageously to herself is, in what she\ncan gain to the Southward. If she possesses\nChs.town with any considerable extent\nof country around it, her claim to Uti pos-\n-sidetis, will appear just [and] reasonable\non this ground, she can be preemptory\nwithout being charged with obstinacy, [and]\nturn the tables on her enemies, [and] charge\nthem with unjustifyable pretintions [sic], to\nprolong the war. It is her business now, to\nappear moderate, knowing our determination\nnever to relinquish any part of the Union.\nThis is the only true, substantial ground\non which she can have the least hopes of \ngaining friends, [and] it is not impossible it\nmay be a successful manuvre [sic]. By the last\n[and] late, accounts from Europe, The Mediating\npowers, were strenuously exerting themselves\nto effect a peace. It is therefore probable that\nfrom this disposition in them, they will not \nsit easy, under a disappointment in a mat-\n-ter they seem to have so much at heart.\nReverse this state of affairs in America,\n[and] see what will be the probable political\nresult. S[h]ould the British possessions be\n[End Page 2]\nconfined to Chs.town, [and] their force in a manner\nbesieged there, the force of her claim quoad this\nobject, will appear weak, so much so, that\nit would not be likely to meet the strenuous\nsupport of the Mediations. Add to this, that\nBritain herself must at once be sensible\nthat the benefit she could propose to herself\nfrom such a possession, would by no means\nbe adequate to the expense of another cam-\n-paign merely on that account. From –\nthese, promises I draw these conclusions.\nThat Britain, from the misfortunes atten-\n-ding her affairs in all parts of the world, in\nthe course of the present year, from her ha-\n-ving drawn on herself a new, [and] obstinate\nenemy, without the least prospect of ac-\n-quiring any friend, with resources, tho\nby no means exhausted, yet much impaired,\nin possession of no more than a couple of\ntowns, out of the thousands that she has\nbeen contending for, I say under these\ncircumstances, Britain will be seriously\ndisposed for peace. But whilst she has\na superior army to the Southward, and\ncan penetrate the country ad libitum,\nshe never will make a peace with her own\nconsent. How far it will be in your power\nto straighten their quarters I know not, but I\n[End Page 3]\nmuch fear your force will be inadequate to the\ngrand object. i.e. Confining them to Chs.town\nYou will no doubt say, this letter speaks\na different language from my former one,\ntrue, [and] for a very substantial reason, I was\nthen taught to believe the reduction of Chs.\ntown, would immediately follow that, of the\nenemie's [sic] force in Virginia; how well founded\nmy information was; you at present know \nas well as I do. The disappointment I must\nconfess, has been a most cruel one to me, both\nas a citizen of So. Carolina, [and] as a citizen of\nAmerica at large; for you observe my opinion\nis still the same; let us get possession of Ch.s\ntown, [and] the war is at an end.\nMrs. Greene has been some days in this\ncity, on her way to Carolina; being still close\nconfined to the house with the gout, I have not\nhad it in my power to wait on her, but all the\nother Carolinians, both Ladies [and] Gentlemen,\nhave been to pay their respects to her. I fear\nher going to Carolina at this time will disgust\nher against the country, not only from its pre-\n-sent confused state, but there will be scarcely\nany of her own sex, with who she can asso-\n-ciate. Adieu My D.r Sir, [and] believe me,\nmost sincerely yours\nJn.o [John] Mathews\n[End Page 4]"
