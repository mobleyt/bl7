He also hopes that the said Gentlemen will not suppose that he is brought to this Exigency through Miscondut or any other ill behavior, but fortune frowned upon him notwithstanding his Assiduity and diligence in his Station of Life: Petitioner is very sorry and almost ashamed to trouble the Worthy Gentlemen with this Petition but hopes they will take his case into Consideration as it's nothing but necessity obliges him thereto, Their Charity shall be ever Acknowledged, and he as in duty bound will ever pray.\n\nAlexander McDonald [signature of applicant]"
