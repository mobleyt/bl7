The dissertation was in Latin. Prof [N?] in his long purple robes, and he seemed really to have [borrowed?] Cicero's [tongue?] with his toga. I never heard such fluency & flowing Ciceronian periods from any mouth before. He not only spoke but thought Latin, and Classic Latin. With such [illegible] I can truly learn much and find that the little which I can impart in reference to the state of things in America Political Social & literary is well received. Slavery is a topic which cannot be understood, which everyone talks about but which I generally excuse myself from speaking upon. So I am passing my summer months here. I feel that the time is[End Page 1] rapidly drawing near when I must leave for more active duties -- but I would gladly learn more before I begin to teach. If I was candidly to give my decision between the position of the humblest, most unlearned in a purely worldly sense, but pious and blessed pastor & preacher of the Gospel in America and the most eminent professor of Theology in Germany, it would not be for the latter. The theory, the philosophy, of Xty is more firmly grasped & understood by this last but the essence is more truly possessed realized and enjoyed by the other. The truth which is only known here is lived there. This is the testimony of these professors themselves in respect to the work of the Christian ministry. Skillful anatomists they are but no physicians for the sick and dying soul. Christianity is a science and[End Page 2] too much an objective, caput morticuum, in all periods of new German theology. Even with the \"mystics\" whose principle is a decidedly subjective one, this becomes paradoxically enough the case and we hear of \"the Philosophy of Christian feeling and belief.\" In Autumn I make my French excursion into literature and customs & mountains, and will return with the opening of the university to Erlangen & then home in the Spring. I hear very little of home & home things and have scarcely an idea how things are going on. I hope however for the best -- by the way I must say a word about German preaching & sermons. You can have no idea how the Pulpit here differs from the \"[illegible]\" in all respects and especially in the style and character of sermons.[End Page 3] Most that I have heard have been simple, exhortatory, verbose, harangues unadorned by learning, imagery or oratory and seemingly designed for women and children. Even distinguished professors here preach sermons which candidates could easily write. Why it is I cannot understand but it seems that they do not understand the art of being plain & simple and at the same time elegant and elevating. Such sermons as Chalmers, Melvilles &c are unheard of & not understood here. [illegible] feature has pleased me very much however [illegible] sermonizing -- which is that though looked down upon along side the \"Lecture\", they are decidedly pious and evangelical. I have not written but one[End Page 4]"
