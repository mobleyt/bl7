      "value": "31\t\t4 26 45\nI loved your description of the paved streets, fat over\nfed people and the non existing knowledge that a war is going\non. Those were the things that made em like New York. I did\nnot want to be reminded that the war was going on when I was\nthere. I was delighted to see the fat people because that\nmeant there must be good food to eat and I could get fat too.\nThe trains did not bother me. I never had any difficulty at\nall in getting drawing rooms and compartments even at the\nlast minute, in fact both Morris and I thought it a lot of\nhuey about the transportation difficulties we had been told\nto expect. You however have so much explorer blood in you that\nyou are miserable unless you are starving or suffering terribly,\nor so active that it amounts to practically the same thing.\nI think I will have to find some kind of an electrical horse\nor some machine that will give you a quick work out in the\nmorning before I get out of bed in order that you will only\nhave the energies of a normal person by the time I shuffle up\nto the breakfast table for a little nourishment.\nWhen I said sell Medway you will note that I always specific\nselling what was our original purchase, the Medway house and\nthe 2200 acres that went with it. I want to keep Pine and\nSpring Grove. On them you have the best quail and duck shooting,\nwill grow for the horses and low maintenance. I would keep\nthe little spring grove house as a shooting box. Make it a\nlittle more attractive. Paint the fence around the paddock\nand the barn,keep a dozen chickens, three horses, two bird\ndogs, Walter and David as the two men and Rosa as the women.\nWe would go there for the shooting and riding without a worry\nin the world. The timber would grow and support the small\nin the world. The timber would grow and support the small\nupkeep of the place with proper t mebering under a forrestor,\nwith our supervision. Then we would go to New York for a week\nor two , stay in the Hampshire House, drink Champagne, whirl\naround, jumping up and down and then leave and return to this\npearl of the Pacific. If our income dropped so low as to\nmake this picture impossible you could take in washing or\nperhaps building an empire in the mornings while I am waking up.\nYou know the taxes on these two peices of property are\nnothing. The insurance mounts to thirty dollars a year or so.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The insurance on Medway alone is $3500. Taces\nare on the same ratio.However do nothing until you come out\nhere and see this place, live here a while and see if the\nclimate agrees with you, then you will be able to make your\ndecision easier. It helps one to see things so much clearer\nand in a proper prospecit e whn you are away, or at least I\nthink it does.\nLet me know what is happening. I really think it will\nbe alright this time. With all my love and a big hsg and kiss\n[End Page 1]\nPlease excuse my not writing before, but everytime I\nwas about to start I thought that the next mail would bring a \nletter from you saying that you had made the necessary arrangement\ns. However the last one that I received said that it was necessar\ny for Stanton to request your services. I judged by this\nthat you had not received my letteradvising that margaret\nhad spoken to Stanton and that he was going to see you in\nWashington and get in touch with you. When I first spoke\nto her she said there was not a chance but on calling her\nagain the next morning she said that Stanton had promised if\narrangements could be made he would do it. Really it looks\nas if everything may go through. Of course you may be taken\nprisoner again by a pack of doodles or some other ferious\narray but it seems to me that luck will break and everything\ncome out alright.\nFinally after six weeks the sun was in the sky again\ntoday and I rushed forth at my lunchoen hour to absorb a little\nand see if I could not exchange the green pallor that lay over\nmy face like a shroud for a little red. Unfortunately I did\nnot succeed completely andto night my face is streaked with\nlines of green and red so that I look something like that famous\ngreen or blue stripped tiger that we went to Indo China for.\nAfter dinner I left Morris who had fever of one hundred and two\nas a result of his typhoid shot and went up to the cliff\noverlooking the beach. The sea stretched to the horizon a xxx\nrippled sheet of gold while on the beach the waveslooked like\nfrozen yellow cream. I sat there for an hour watching the sea,\nlike xxxxxxxxxxxx black rocks glistening and the almost ghost\nline of white breakers cut of thepath of the moon.\nI had taken a captains car back to his wife. The captain\nhad left the office with the request that we deliver this car and\nwhen I drove up to the house I heard a wailing like that of a\nfrightened child. You know how I feel about children especially\ncrying ones, but as I beat a hasty retreat the wife said that\nis poor Sampson. I thought that Sampson was making hell of\na lot of noise biblical character or not, but Sampson turned\nour to be a cat that had climbed a cocanut palm and could not\nget down. Let me take this opportunity to tell you that I\ndid not climb that tree and rescue Sampson. Those days are \nlong past. Neither id I stand under the tree and speak soft\ntalk , \"Kitty Kitty, sweet pussy come down\" I said let the dam\ncat stay up there, maybe he will fall out and break his neck.\nThis story I tell you in order that you may expect to see my\nmy sullen jowls, scowling brow and bald head when God brings\nus together again. Also please either send or bring me\nenough material to puxt in patched in the back of all my trousers\nin order that I can make the waist line larger.\n[End Page 2]"
