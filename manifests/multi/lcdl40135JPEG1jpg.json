      "value": "14 Dec 1832 My dear Brother Eliza tells me that you have had fever and are not well! May He have mercy upon an afflicted family and preserve and restore you. I feel daily my dear Brother more strongly how [illegible] is a christian's [illegible] below yet I cling to that [illegible]. The world gives us [no?] [illegible] which we are not [illegible] to turn away even our eyes. That family and religious [communion?] united is rendered very precious to us. I thank you for your letter communicating the intelligence of dear Hetty's departure. I sinned in my grief and God punished me by a guilty conscience. But I give him glory and thanks that he has comforted me and enabled me to bless and praise him in all of his ways. All that you said of our dear Sister was afterwards very soothing. I wept and weep but not as thou without hope. I believe that she is with our gracious [illegible] and I feel that the time of our separation will be short. My dear Brother our kind Master has been much with me. I find my understanding much enlightened and more clearly discern the spirituality of a Christian's walk. I begin to comprehend better the writings of St Paul and the true nature of the Soul. I have lately been [illegible] the writings of Coleridge and find that [illegible] my for [illegible] state. I considered [illegible] the mystics [illegible] Philosophers had really [illegible] much [illegible] to the truth than many divines who are considered Orthodox. The understanding of many of them way doubtless enlightened though their hearts were unchanged. Coleridge refers for authority frequently to St Paul and I correct all tendency to corrupt the simplicity of the Gospel by bringing him to the standard of that Holy Apostle.[End Page 1] I find that even an approach to the high spirituality of the Religion of Jesus is unintelligible to the anti Christian world nor would they speak more respectfully of St Paul than they do of Jacob. [Illegible] did not the hypocritical respect of the [world?] compell them to belie their true sentiments. I can now sit and meditate over the works of the Apostle and find comfort and strength in which words I formerly could perceive nothing but unintelligible jargon. I have [had?] many holy musings upon [illegible] of viii Romans. There is no [illegible] [illegible] And then I [illegible] are the confines which divide us from those who also [illegible] in Christ Jesus whether they still move upon the earth or have removed to Heaven. Our soul leaves sense leaves the mere material existence and mingles with and holds communion with the soul of Christ or God and in him with [illegible] souls of those who are his. I am [unalteringly?] drawn from [illegible] sweet thoughts to worldly cares and [drink?] with [instinctive?] terror from the cold atmosphere of its near neighborhood. For my dear Brother although I give [him?] thanks I feel that the work of some [illegible] has been carried on by him. Yet how constantly and strongly do I resist his gracious efforts and how slowly do I come under his perfect obedience. My deceitful heart would frequently lay the change to the times and my [illegible] situation but I know that he has promised strength for every trial and I feel that he is willing but that I am rebellious. I am afraid to speak for my tongue is my shame and [illegible] sin of [illegible] myself to the world's [illegible] by [illegible] my heart condemned till [tarnishes?] me by its [illegible]. [illegible] my dear Brother heavy trials seem to await us. I fear [illegible] we shall not be able to preserve peace. The extreme violence of the President and as I believe his revengeful feelings toward Mr Calhoun will with the complete apathy of the other Southern states involve us in harm. I have been too instrumental in the proceedings which have preceded this catastrophe not to have made it a subject of deep and fervent humiliation and prayer[End Page 2] I know that I cannot stand before his judgement seat but I give him [prayer?]. I am enabled to [cast the?] [burden?] on the Lord. I desired to promote the [illegible] of others and as I still perceive that my predominant [motive?] was not selfish I can [leave?] the event to him. I could have desired that another path should have been allowed to me but as I trust that they will all lead to him. I give myself not too much anxiety in the choice. I am greatly [illegible] and now feel that if he prescribes I can pass to him from [illegible] or the scaffold [illegible] equal mind. I congratulate you my [dear Brother?] on the birth of your [Son?]. I know that can place him in the hand of God and that he will give you the comfort [illegible] preserve and take upon himself the care of the future. Eliza tells me that Catherine continues quite well. I hope that this letter may [illegible] her so give my love to her and kiss the little stranger. [illegible] hope [illegible] all on my return. I presume that you have not yet fixed yourself [illegible]. If you are there at [illegible] of Congress I think that [illegible] must postpone my return home for a few days to see you [illegible] my [illegible] Brother I have a human longing to see you all that makes us [illegible] When I think of you. It seems to me that I [grieve?] that I too could [illegible] have been present with you all to say \"good bye\". Give me your prayers dear Brother that I may have the meek spirit of our holy master for I am in the midst of violence of speech and wrath of heart....I sometimes feel too the old spirit of pride and savage striving for mastery but I follow the [precepts?] of my master in my prayers and find [illegible] for whom I pray. [illegible] my love to our dear sisters. God be with [illegible] his [illegible] be especially with her who is most [illegible] Nary I pray that she may be supported, comforted, elevated that her communion may be closer and sweeter with him in whose bosom our sufferer on earth now takes her Rest. My dear Brother May He whom you serve continue and increase to you all the blessings which he bestows upon his best beloved. Your affectionate Brother RW Barnwell[End Page 3] Free RW Barnwell H Rep To Wm H Barnwell Esq Beaufort So Carolina[End Page 4]"
