As in the previous Williamsburg  concert series, of which this will be  the sixth, the programs have been  seected largey from music known  to Coonia Virginia, or in some  way connected with old Williamsburg. The interest of a coonia  America in music is shown from the  following advertisement, which was  run in the Virginia Gazette, pub-  ished in Williamsburg, in 1771:   \"Charleston, South Carolina, Apri  11, 1771, THE ST. CECIIA SOCIETY give Notice, that they will j  engage with, and give suitable Encouragement to, Musicians propery  quaified to perform at their Concert, provided they appy on or before the first Day of October next.  The Performers they are in Want  of are, a first and second Vioin,  two Hautboys, and a Bassoon, whom  they are wiing to agree with for  one, two or three years. John Gordon, President. Thomas n. Smith,  Vice President\".  The\" music has been cued from  works mentioned in survliving inventories, etters and newspaper advertisements. For example Martha  Jefferson\"s copy of the \"Pieces de  Cavecin\" of Caude Babastre, her  music teacher in Paris, is still in  existence at Monticeo, and several  seections from, the book will be  payed by Raph Kirkpatrick, director of the festiva and a harpsichordist who is noted for his recitals in New York\"s Town Hall and  Carnegie Ha. A number of the  works chosen are being performed  from the origina editions, several  of them not repubished since the  eighteenth  century.  The concerts, which started with  a series of informa harpsichord recitals by Mr. Kirkpatrick in the  spring of 1938, have grown until  they have become unique events,  comparable in a smaer way to the  famous European music festivas,  and which draw a briiant audience of music overs, socialites and  ceebrities from a over the country. During toe series Williamsburg  presents a gay picture, reminiscent  of the gaa \"Publick Times\" of the  eighteenth century. The inns and  taverns are crowded, most of the  townspeople \" have their hoses fu  of guests, the owners of the neighboring plantations and country  places-Carter\"s Grove, York Ha,  Westover-come in for the music,  and there is a constant round of  parties and entertainments.  Apart from the music, its setting  is an irresistibe attraction to many  people, for toe great baroom of  the Paace where the concerts take  place is iuminated by candes, the  instruments of the performers are  authentic ones of . the period, and  during the intermission the audience may stro in the moonight  through the Paace gardens. Guests  are escorted to the door by ackeys  bearing anterns, and from the  cupoa of the Paace shines the  \"great anthorn\" which was aways  it for the Roya Governors\" ceebrations.  Two series will be given during  the week, one on Monday, Tuesday  and Wednesday, November 10-12,  and the same programs repeated on  Thursday, Friday and Saturday,  November 12-15. Mr. Kirkpatrick  has engaged to assist him a superative corps of artists, including the  word-famous Budapest quartet;  Miss Frances Baisde, foremost  American woman futist; Miss ois  Wann, an oboist who has been sooist with leading American and European orchestras; and Eias Carman, bassoonist- noted for his interpretations of eary music. One  program in each series will be  m;jsic for the harpsichord by  Mr. Kirkpatrick, one will be  music for strings by the Budapest  quartet, and one will be music for  the harpsichord and wind instruments by Mr. Kirkpatrick, Mr. Carman and the Misses Wann and  Baisde. \n\n[End Page 2]"
