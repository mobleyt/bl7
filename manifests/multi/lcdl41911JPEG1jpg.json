      "value": "A.M.D.G Ursuline Convent & Academy at \"Valle Crucis\"--Near Columbia, SoCar. Oct 28th 1865 Revd J.W. Cummings, DD. Revd & respected Father, I take the liberty of enclosing a letter to my Brother, supposing that you will be one of the first among his friends north, whom he will have the pleasure to see on his return. We have been very anxious owing to the prevalence of the cholera, especially as we hoped the news of his \"pardon\" had reached him long since.[End Page 1] The Hand of God presses heavily upon us & this time death has chosen one of our most gifted & loveable young sisters-- My own niece & that of the Bishop--Sister Gertrude, for whom I beg your prayers. We are now in a quiet country place & the college in which we sojourned is the principal Hotel in Columbia. Mr. John Kenny no doubt informed you of the general condition of the South & more especially of ours. I regretted his not having proper credentials, which was owing to my being misinformed on the subject. I was sorry that I happened to mention any percentage of Ms. Kehoe [?] who wrote me that you spoke to him of being a collector for us & am exceedingly obliged, both to yourself & him, for[End Page 2] your kindness in our behalf. As the mails are so very uncertain, & you had some funds of ours in hand, O took the liberty of telling him to call on you for the small amount which he had expended for us in postage, & by which I was sorry to have inconvenienced him. If convenient you can place the remainder in the hands of my Brother when you see him. Begging your charitable prayers for myself & sisters. I remain Revd & respected Father with much esteem Your humble sister in J.C. The Mother Superior[End Page 3]"
