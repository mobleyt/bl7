I Know not what to think If she was persuaded into it by her Mother and others. I can see no grounds on which she could build the slightest excuse-- a girl who loves, and was loved as she Knew you did love. should have [cast?] aside all such advice-- come though it be from her own Mother-- and laid her case before you and you only-- she is free with regard to worldly matters and I do so believe in real reciprocal love, as to think she should disregard all advice coming from her mother at this late time, and have clung to him who was in all save[End Page 1] a few [illegible] one and the same with her self-- Such a intimate acquaintance and such firm confidence would not [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: hole in page] been sundered by a noble hear [illegible: hole in page] I write as though the things [illegible: hole in page] for ever I do not believe you would trust your future happiness, in such a [illegible: hole in page] vessle but you have asked that [illegible: hole in page] not speak harshly of her [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: hole in page] sake; and I wont. I like her or rather [illegible: hole in page] liked her much-- and so abuse I shant indulge in because it is, undignified, but I will suppose a case-- you have heard it before-- Suppose Amelia Ball always liked you saw you liked her, her Mother and family liked you-- nay wished you to marry her-- she brought up to think what her Mother thought was right-- thought she loved you and daily schooled herself to think so more what then. you court her she believes,-- perhaps. she loves and accepts you-- Her Mother again, anyhow her Mother supports her opinion But when she comes to the three year engagement[End Page 2] she finds her heart failing her-- Her Mothers feelings-- from what cause not Known changed too-- the [prospect of] being a ministers wife and the great [illegible: hole in page] to under go-- all of these striking [illegible: hole in page] upon her heart. Rob if you would excuse her-- those are the only grounds-- [In?] thinking on the matter they have forced them selves up [illegible: hole in page] If they are the real motives which [illegible: hole in page] her in breaking off the engagement which existed under such circumstances-- you should be glad-- rejoiced that God had not permitted your early [hopes?] affections, to be placed for ever in such a one and rejoice in the escape you have had-- Disappointment after marriage-- distrust suspicion of your wife-- to be with her daily and Know she loves you not-- Oh if there be a curse laid up for me-- may it not be in a wife-- but enough-- I am sorry for you and hope you will get a better-- when you get engaged again dont have a 3 year one.
