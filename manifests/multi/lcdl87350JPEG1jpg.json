Governor of South Carolina,\nSir\nI herewith tender my Resignation as Captain of the Waccamaw Light Artillery; to take effect on the 3rd inst.\nIn explanation of the above I make the following statement, - \nThe Waccamaw Light Artillery tendered its services to the state on 16th Day of Jany. as a volunteer company asking to be detailed for Sea Coast defence in All Saints Parish; on the 11th of Febuary they were ordered to take post in that capasity, by Chas. Allston jr.; supposing the authority thus vested to be but temporary, the order was obeyed. While preforming duty, their Rights were disregarded, they remonstrated, were informed that your Exlency fully sustaind Chas Allston jr. in ALL HE HAD DON. Orders were again Received dated March 8th to serve 3 weeks in the same capasity, and again we were placed under the Orders of Charles Allston jr; the Order was Obeyed. The manner in which the Company has been treated has created\n[page 2]\nDissensions. I believe their is just cause, and must decline serving in any capasity under one I cannot respect.\nFurthermore I have Removed beyond the Limits of the Regiment from which the Waccamaw Light Artillery was formed and would Respectfully beg of you your early attention. The company is under the command of [Lift - I Avard?].\nRespectfully your Obt. Sert.\nTho. W. Daggett.\n\n[page 3]\nResignation of Captain\nDaggett of Waccamaw\nLight Infantry.\nJune 1st 1861,\nAccepted\n\nCapt. Daggett - \nresignation - \n\nI regret it and desire \n[â€¦?]\nFW Pickens"
