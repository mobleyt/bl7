      "value": "Camp of 1st S C V  Near Frederick Md  Sept 6th 1862  J B Heyward Esq  Columbia S.C.  Dr Sir  I suppose ere this you have learned from dispatch sent to the Courier by Capt Barksdale, of the death of your Son Nathaniel; knowing that sympathy can lighten the affliction this has caused yourself and family very little, I write principally to give a few particulars of his death. Our Brigade had been fighting desperately all day against overwhelming numbers, as fast as one Brig of the enemy were routed a fresh one would be sent in, in this way our Brigade during the day had stood its ground and  [End Page 1] repulsed five different Brigades of the enemy. Nat had fought all day with marked gallantry always among the formost in the charge. It was about sundown and the musketing in our part of the field had ceased. The men were sitting down talking and resting. Lieut Munro, Nat Heyward and several others in a group were talking on the actions of the day when a shell exploded about fifteen feet from them, a piece of which instantly killed both the Lieut and Nat, striking them in the head.  For want of time and utencils, I was compelled to bury them in the same grave, and have marked the spot by cutting his initials - Regt. on a small piece of board (\"NH - 1st SCV\") which can be identified by myself and several of the company at any time  [End Page 2] Your Boy John is here and as my Boy has left me I have taken him into my service  he expresses a willingness and desire to remain and If you do not object I would be glad to hire him from you, at whatever rate you may deem sufficient but if you wish him to return I will give him every facility for doing so, in my powers though I thin it would be dangerous in his attempting it now.   I will close, tendering yourself and family my heartfelt sympathy  Very Respectfully  Your Obdt Servt  Jno. W. Chambers  1st Lieut Comdg Co L 1st SCV  P.S. Capt Barksdale died of his wound last Monday week living but a little over two days after it was recd.  [End Page 3]"
