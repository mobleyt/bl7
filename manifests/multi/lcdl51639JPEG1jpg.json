      "value": "St. Mary's Rectory,\n86 Wentworth Street,\nCharleston, S. C.\n\nSt. Patrick's Day. 1896.\n\nMy dear Mr. Riley,\n\tIt is a matter of sincere regret to me that I cannot be with you tonight to enjoy the 95th Anniversary Celebration of your Society. This morning I was compelled to make several appointments for this evening connected with the present improvements in this venerable old church of St. Mary. Please sympathize with me in my regret that I am unable to be with you in body as I am in spirit.\n\t Your festive gathering tonight will renew, not only your devotedness to the land and the principles of St. Patrick, but also, in view of \n[End Page 1]\nrecently developed [antagonists?] in our midst; your conviction that your civic duties in a free country are no less a responsibility than the patriotic defense of your country in days of danger. Our civic and religious liberties are a holy trust from God for the benefit of future generations. When un American principles would assert themselves in our midst, we must realize that it is our duty so to administer a free and popular government that the enemies of true democracy may not prevail. The teachings of St. Patrick perpetuated by your Society proclaim friendship, unity and true Christian charity, friendship towards all men pure and practical, which means frank and honest and upright dealing between man and man, without intrigue or misrepresentation; unity, not only in what concerns spiritual interests, but in all that affects the body politic, and teaches us to support all that is for the general public welfare; true Christian charity, which beyond the case of our needy brother has a higher political meaning, for it bids us to love and cherish the public weal not only in times of war, but also when in times of peace the baneful seed of distrust and dissension are sown.\n\tIf today's celebration renew in your hearts the virtues and religion which St. Patrick preached to the Hibernians of his day, they will, in spite of the [pipings?] of ignorance and bigotry, perpetuate a race of noble and upright souls with whose hands and care may safely be \n[End Page 2]\ncommitted that magnificent inheritance we are proud to call \"Our Country.\" For \n\"What constitutes a State? \n\"Not high raised battlements or labored mounds,\n\"Thick walled, or moated gate. \n\"Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crowned.\n\"NO   Men, highminded men, \n\"Men who their duties know,\n\"But know their rights, and, knowing dare maintain, \n\"Prevent the long aimed blow,\n\"And crush the bigot while they spurn his chain.\n\"These constitute a State.\"\n\tIn fullest sympathy with the aims and objects of the Hibernian Society of Charleston, I am \n\nYours sincerely,\nThos. F. Hopkins,\nRector of St. Mary's\n\nMr. A. J. Riley\nChairman Mang. Com.\nHibernian Society.\nCharleston S. C.\n[End Page 3]"
