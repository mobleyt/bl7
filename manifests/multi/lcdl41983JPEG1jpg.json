      "value": "John Lynch  Columbia Feby 5th 1860  Dear Brother,  I recd your 3rd containing check $350 yesterday morning.  Called on Brown, and delivered your message telling him I was prepared to pay if it was necessary, he said Mr_ was not in town and he would wait 'till you came up, when he would have the bond at the Bank, (Dr B_ has it still).  I recd a letter in the evening from Anna - she expects to come over alone on Tuesday.  My intention was to meet her at Kingsville, if you are coming up in the day train, you will meet her also, all were well at home, I hope you have met Mr and Mrs Henderson, who are in Charleston, stopping at the Charleston Hotel, I believe Mr. H was confirmed last Sunday, a pity he has not been thrown in Catholic society, he might have been another to the list I see by the Miscellany the Drs here have made.  I expect you will have Mr Hope & Palmer calling on you when you come up. All well at the convent, and with us  Pray for your affectionate brother John  Rt. Revd P N Lynch D.D."
