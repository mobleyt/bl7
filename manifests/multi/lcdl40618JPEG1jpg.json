      "value": "Sandy Knowe Tuesday Febry 4th '45 My Dear Mamma, Just from table I am, being put into a very good humour by receiving Tare's letter before dinner--and I dined on very nice, tender turkey (my favorite dish.) So no wonder at my good humour--Well, we are all quite well and pretty near our departure for Charleston--Next Monday, nothing preventing, we expect to leave for Friendfield hoping to reach home Wednesday evening--and right glad shall we be to see you there at your appointed time--Uncle and Aunt Withers left us last Thursday for Dr. Heriot's, where they still are--they were here about 5 or 6 days--the old gentleman seemed extremely feeble when they got here, but he has gained much strength since, and seems much better, though, to be sure, his mind seems very feeble. He went down to the Chapel Sunday, and a very cold day it was--he was anxious to get back to Friendfield--but Dr. Heriot went down yesterday--the overseer having written to tell him that 10 of the negroes had taken to the woods, owing to some dissatisfaction with him--they must be a most unruly, wretched set--I'm sure I do not envy their profession-- Dr. Heriot has had enough to do for him--I really think he deserves renumeration--I am sorry for the old gentleman and hope he may become less cumbered with the things of this world. We hope and think he seems more interested about serious matters--I was quite pleased to see that he would[End Page 1] not retire till after prayers--'twas over at Mrs. Heriot's. Mr. Glennie had gone out to perform service for the negroes, and Aunt Withers said he had gone into his room, where he was reading, waiting for Mr. G to come in--Elizabeth stayed with Sarah--and hoped to have Sarah with her at Friendfield. We hope to find them there on our way--There is no truth in the report about E's engagement for her mother did not say a word about it, though now that the other is married, I should not be surprised at it--Jane and Harleston came over to dinner with us while they were here. Dr. Sparkman also fell in to dinner the same day, and Mr. & Mrs. Wood paid a visit and Mrs. Weston and Fraser were here the other morning. These all the visitors lately--We paid a Bridal visit yesterday morning our neighbor Josh LaBruce has taken to himself a wife--Miss Mortimer, no Hazlehurst--and we were quite pleased with her, so easy and sociable--I dare say she'll make a good neighbour--in the evening we went over to the Dr.'s out both morning evening you see, even on Sandy Island? There is to be a dinner party to the couple at Mr. Wood's this--I suppose we'll be invited, and if so, weather permitting, I'll not object to the frolic--like very well to see a little that's going on about me. But I hope not to have any visitors this week, I shall have enough to occupy me in the business way--I wanted to have dined at [Jane's?] before I left, but doubt if shall be able to spare time--Well, I believe I have gotten through most of the week laid out--I have Rose on the comfortable today--[End Page 2] and hope she may succeed as well as you always have--[mind?] permitting. Mr. Belin proposes sending off the vessel Saturday that we may find our servants there--I hope and think, weather good, we shall have a very comfortable time down--and I hope we may be able to return pretty early in April, when I do sincerely hope Tare will be of our party--Hess is as well as she can be, and full of spirits, never for a minute still--but obstinate little monkey, she cannot walk or talk near as well as I should wish her to do before you see her--I got a letter from William today--he was quite well--his letter dated Jany 3rd off [illegible]--he said a Brig was to sail for Charleston so he would not let so good an opportunity pass without writing--poor fellow. I shall be right glad to see him home again--he tells me to \"give the Juvenile a kiss\" for him--so like him--Well I must go [now?] and see little Hess to bed--I found her in a sweet humour--she has gone to bed, cocoa is over and here I am to say goodnight presently--this has been a tempestuous day--the wind is now howling and tomorrow we'll expect to find cold enough--I'm sitting by a nice fire, with a bright light and some nice [jelly?] to wind up with. I wish Tare had a tumbler too, for I know she is fond of it--Mr. Belin is amusing himself with a newspaper--and do you have the Keiths with you? The house must be quite like old times--noisy enough--Tell Rye when I ask Hess if she'll be my pet, she shakes her head--when I say who? She says Rye--and so Miss Maria is to visit you? What started her? I suppose Mr. Keith will have left you. I wish I could pay you a visit some time or other--I want to see Hopeton-- [End Page 3] Do tell Tare I am much obliged to her for the mat--it will be very acceptable--also the other matters--just what I shall want--Tell her I hope she will pronounce Hess a miracle of good behavior when she is a little older--if she is not I'm sure it will not be her Papa's fault--he has such correct notions about such matters--And now my Dear Mamma I must bid you goodnight--Mr. Belin joins me in much love to dear Papa yrself and Tare--Kiss the children for me and tell Louisa [howdya?]--yr truly affete daughter Virginia W Belin quite a flourish! Mrs Willis Wilkinson Care of Dr. Willis Wilkinson Orangeburg So Ca [End Page 4]"
