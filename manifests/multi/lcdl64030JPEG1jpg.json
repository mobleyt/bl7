      "value": "Charleston  23rd Aug. 1819    It has fallen to my lot, my dear Madam, to be bereaved of my Son Nathaniel. I have to communicate to you the most afflicting news of his death which occurred in Philadelphia on the 15th intent with perfect composure and resignation.    On the 9th inst. he had a return of his inflammatory disorder, and on the 13th he thought himself better, from his hands being cool, and he supposed himself free from fever; but this was the coldness of death which was never to go off --- He suffered little -- with clasped hands, and quivering lips, he resigned his breath with perfect humility.    I am unable at this time, my dear Madam, to say more: And can only recommend his infant children to your protection and the affections of your family.  I am Madam  very respectfully and truly yrs.  Nath. Heyward [End Page 1]Mrs. Barnwell  Beaufort  So.Ca. [End Page 2]"
