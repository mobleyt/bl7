      "value": "[Charles Petit to Nathanael Greene \nFebruary 13, 1781\n[RvW Box 1, Folder 2 MSS. – A.L.]]\n\n\nPhiladelphia 13th Feb.y. [February] 1781\nI am now, my dear Sir, to acknowledge the receipt of your\ntwo favours by General Duportail [and] Major Giles; the latter\ncame to hand a day or two before the other. We can hardly\nenough extol the bravery and good conduct of General Morgan\nand the little corps of heroes under his command. Nor are we\nunmindful of the merit [and] skill of the General who has made\nso happy a disposition of his small resources as to battle and\nimpede the approach of an enemy with a force so much\nSuperior to his. We flatter ourselves with the expectation of\nsomething brilliant in a few days from your left; but it\nmust be brilliant indeed to out shine what has happened on\nyour right. We chimney corner soldiers do not always judge\nrightly of actions in the field, but we must nevertheless be\nallowed, or at least we take the liberty, to utter our opinions\non all that happen which have enough in them of either good or\nill to draw attention. We now give the palm clearly to Genl. [General]\nMorgan on a supposition that the action of the Cowpens, in\npoint of real bravery, generalship in action, and good soldiership,\nexcels all that have happened, taking all circumstances into\nview, that of Stoney point not excepted. I need not descant on\nthe particular merits of each nor draw those parts into com-\nparison which are most worthy of notices; neither shall I now\nenquire whether this piece of success was aided by the ill\nconduct of the enemy. It is enough that the victory was complete,\nand achieved in the open field by inferior numbers labouring\nunder many other disadvantages, over the chosen troops of a\nboasting enemy. Could we know that you were in a con-\nditon to follow up the blow and avail yourself properly\nof the advantages such as a victory ought to give you, our joy\nwould be supreme. But the chilling reflections of your real\nsituation is mortifying to the friends of America in proportion\nto their knowledge of it, and strikes your personal friends with\nadditional chagrin. Be not, however, discouraged. If you fail\nof the success we wish, you will hardly fall short of what\nwe have a right to expect. From these considerations some\nconsolation\n[End Page 1]\nconsolation may be drawn, hard as it is to be reduced to such resources\nfor it. The eyes and expectations not only of America, but of Europe\nare upon you. Your military character, though it has less to lose than\nsome others in the world, from being less known that it deserves, has\nthe extensive field of fame before it; and though you many meet with\nimpediments and difficulties which may require more than common\nfortitude and common skill to withstand and surmount them, there\nis yet a chance of your triumphing over them. The war in America\ndepends not solely on the circumstances arising within it. A lucky\nturn elsewhere may weaken the enemy, or strengthen our hands in\na manner that may occasion a favourable change [and] turn the tide\nin our favour. \nThe traitor who has lately with so much success, and with\na shameful want of molestation on our part, impeded the reinforces\nments [and] supplies which would otherwise have come to you, we have\nreason to believe is recalled from Chesapeak. The Storm which hap-\npened some weeks since has done more damage to the enemy's fleet\nat Gardner's Island than we at first imagined. I have it from a\nmember of Congress today that the culloden is entirely lost [and] but\n17 of the crew saved, a frigate also lost; a 90 Gun ship blown out\nto sea dismasted, and one or two other ships of the line dismasted,\nbesides other damage less conspicuous. This leaves a superiority\nin favour of the fleet of our ally, and it is whispered, but I have\nno certainty of it, that a few ships are detached from R. Island.\nThe supposition is that they are gone to Chesapeak. If they should\ncatch Mr. Arnold there, it would be a clever stroke. These, however,\nare but flattering suggestions of what may happen, and I have not\nsolid authority for the supposition. I take it for granted however\nthat on these probabilities the Enemy's force will be recalled from\nChesapeak; but you will know more of the matter before this\nreaches you.\nI believe I have heretofore mentioned to you the arrange-\nments going forward respecting the great branches of business,\nand that Mr. Livingston [and] Mr. Lee were in nomination for a \nchoice of minister for foreign affairs. No election has yet been\nmade, and perhaps may not be speedily. As Financier, Governor\nJohnston, Rob.r Morris, George Bryan [and] John Gibson have been put\nin nomination. A friend of yours was sounded on this subject [and]\nat his request his name has been kept out of sight. The two first\nI\n[End Page 2]\nI hear have declared off. Mr. G. will probably get but the\nvote of the one who named him. For the War Department\nGenl. [General] Gates, Genl Sullivan, Mr. Peters, [and] Col. [Colonel] Pickering [and] Col. [Colonel] Scam-\n-mell have been talked on, [and] I believe put in nomination.\nFor Minister of marine Sr. James Jay is making interest.\nYour friend has also been asked for his name on this occasion,\nbut he does not choose it should run for either tho he were\nsure it would succeed.\nThe Jersey line made but a poor hand of their attempt to\nrevolt; but about 150 came into the measure; they were\nsoon suppressed, 2 of them executed [and] the rest pardoned.\nYou will excuse the shortness of this, if such an appology [sic]\nbe necessary – as writing by candle light under a cold which\ngives me a disordered head, is not pleasant. If matter and\nopp occasion offers before I find an opportunity of conveyance\nI will begin again.\n[End Page 3]\n[Addressed:]\nHonourable\nMajor General Greene\nCommanding the Army of the\nUnited States\nCarolina\n[written upside down on bottom edge]\nFrom Col Pettit\nFeb. 13th. 1781.\n[End Page 4]"
