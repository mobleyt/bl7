      "value": "May 1st.\nDear Sidney,\nI got your letter 31. I have seen Stanton Griffis. He wanted\nme to go out as a property owner. I said I must go for him in a job. He said\nhe will go to Washington and see what he can do and will let me know next\nSunday May 6 th. I hope it works. He claims if I go for him I will go by\nboat on the next shipment which he has no idea what the date will be. I hope\nI hear something really definate soon. It sounds possible but far from sure.\nI have my fingers crossed.\nI saw Fighting Lady with Ellen the other night and thinks it s a\ngreat picture. One the way back being unable to get a taxi Ellen and I were\nwalking up Lexington Avenue, one of my ear rings fell off and rolled through\na grating on the side walk. It was the air vent for the subway. We reported\nthe loss to the ticked taker at the booth. He told me to come back in the\nmorning and he would have a man there to hunt for it on a step ladder. Ire-\nturned and was then told two men had already searched and had not found it.\nI went to the Police Station and reported the loss, have advertised in the paper\nhave offered to reward etc. etc. The theory is that children with sticks and chew\nwing gum make a habit of finding things in drains which has probably happened\nthis time. The point of the story however is this. The ear ring are a pair\njust bought by me a Cartier.The bill is not even paid yet and I have no\ninsurance coverage. The funny part of the tale is that I bought the ear rings\nin order to make Cartier condicend to ingrave the date on the back of the\n[End Page 1]\nGeneva watch I bought for you and which they had refused to do because it was 'nt\na Cartier watch. Ellen jockingly said you must spend a thousand dollars and buy\nsomething in order to have them do that ingraving. For fun we looked at ear rings\n- I fell for a pair,and Ellen the perfect saleswoman helpdthe sale along no\nend. I emerged with a resplendent pair of 14kt.gold knot ear rings studded\nat intervals with saphires and diamond. Really a wonderful looking heavy\npair of globs- and now there it is one down the drain and already lost.\nI believe my good luck that persued me for six months and the lucky star\nthat guided me is about to sign off for a while and maybe this is what is\ncomming to me for a bit only perhaps the beginning. If it is nothing\nmore serious however than a pair of ear rings I wont mind.\nHoney found a mouse to-night under the radiator and the\nexcitement was like Medway in the kitchen before we go to bed. He flopped\naround the floor with that fat stomach flat ,and all paws stretched out and\nthe usual high squweeks of pleasure while the children howled with excitement\nand could n't finish their supper.\nI am off to bed now darling and only wish I were with you out\nthere with you instead of here.\nI haven't gotten down to Medway.I know it must look like a jungle.\nI think we should leave it as is till we know what we want to do.\nWe have no cook and Rose is doing it.\nLoads of love-\nGertrude Legendre\nEllen sends [illegible] these pictures of her suit you sent her-\nHas n't caught a beaux yet despite a exposed mid rif - so\nshe says-\nP.S. Jimmie Legendre [Anne's child] was killed\nApril 8th in action Germany -\n[End Page 2]"
