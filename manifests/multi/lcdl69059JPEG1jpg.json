      "value": "April 20, 1944\n102\nDear Gertie,\nYour letter arrived describing your luncheon with\nthe Beligian Ambassador. It sounded to me that as old as you\nare you were still a little out of your class if all the men\nwere your grand fathers confidants. What amazed me the most\nwas the description of the menu. How in the world do they\nmanage to give those banquets when the rest of the country is\nstruggling along on ration points and counting on their fingers\nthe number of months that must pass before they will be able to\nhave meat or butter again. However as long as you are asked\nto these feasts it is alright. The time to complain ls when\nthey forget to\"request your presence\".\nI know exactly how you feel when the first buds\ncome out on the trees. There is no torture so great as to have\nto go into a gloomy office building, turn on the light and sit\ndown at a desk piled high with papers that have lost what little\nthey might have originally had before you saw the bud. Here\nfortunately it is always spring. There are not any seasons.\nSummer is hotter than winter by perhaps three or five degrees,\nbut otherwise there is nothing to indicate to a new arrival\nthe time of the year. The same flowers appear to be blooming,\nthe mountains are always green and covered with mist in une early\nmorning, and latxxer the sky becomes one immense canopy of\nlight, sun drenched blue and the day is under way. But to\nshow you how much places are a matter of the mind, Armant does\nnot like it here. He thinks the climate is damp and says he xx\nfeels enervated and tired as a result. To him it is no better if\nnot worse than New Orleans. I admit that you always feel tired\nhere but what ofit. Can you imagine a more beautiful place to\nbe tired in, and as mans lot is to be born tired I can ask for\nno more. \nI am now growing really fat as three weeks have passed\nand my cracked ribs have not healed. As a result the doctor says\nthat I must give up even the gentlest forms of exercise such as\nsneezing and blowing my nose hard and remain absolutely quiet.\nThey were supposed to have been well at the end of dares weeks\nand instead they hut more than the day when I broke them. It makes\nme furious not to be able to go swimming or play tennis etc. when\nthey are at my door. One deos not mind quite so much when these\nsports are unavaible, but when they are within easy reach it is\na different situatition. I took Armant to my Lady Oesteopath and\nhe calls her the little old lady and lives by what she tells him\nto do. I believe if she gave the order to march into the sea she\nwould have her command obeyed. Morris looks on the whole matter\nwith great disdain and I am not sure that he is not the cleverest.\nI think we are maybe the subjects, willing I grant, of a doctor\n[End Page 1]\nwho treats her profession as a business and likes nice steady\ncustomers just like a grocery store does.\nThe apartment is making no headway whatsoever as far\nas being decorated is concerned. The curtains that were ordered\nwere never made because the store discovered to its suprise that\nit did not have the cloth after all. It had a sample but nothing\nmore. The man that was to make the big couch which is called\nsomething that sounds like a hicky ay\"just has not got around to\nit\". The wall in Morrises room still has its big blotch of paint,\nThe painter who painted the living room and with whom we had\na fight, or rather Morris had a small discussion because he agreed\nto pay him by the day and the days were very long, has left his\npaints and brushed in the middle of the room. The old women who\nlived in the mountains amd who came down from her hermitage\nespecially to weave us a mat cheaper than anyone else has left\nafter weaving a mat that is to small and whose edge[s]look like a\npath left by a drunken serpent. The cook however that we snared\ninto our lair by giving her the best apartment in the buildling and\nseveral thousand dollars a month is wonderful. She is a tiny\nlittle Japanese girl who lives with her husband just below us.\nShe keeps everything spotless and moves around so quickly that\nthere is only a blur of light to be seen. She is also I THINK\na wonderful cook but has been held down somewhat by Morris insist-\ning that all we have eaten in our lives and all we wish to eat\nis rice and potaotes. Armant says he is getting fatter and fatter\nand hungrier and hungrier on this diet. But then he is a weakling\nand not worthy of our sympathy.\nI understand your big Boss went through herebut at the time\nI did not see or hear of him. Only after he left did we receive\na letter saying,he was comming. But that is how I like things to\nhappen. It places everything in its true light and importance.\nIt really did not matter whether he came or not as far as the\ngreat rank and file were cXoncerned. Had he tunred up it would\nhave meant that we would all have had to salute and stop working.\nNews to give you is such a rarity that whenever an item a small\nmorsel passes me I snatch itwith huhgry hands. The last few days\nhave unfortunately been very poor and my catch is not only meagre\nbut non existing. I have seen no one, heard nothing either\ngood or evil and done nothing. All our interest are fixed on\nthe comming invasion and our pray[er] is that we will do better than\nwe have been doing in Itatly. Even the military magazines admit\nthat we are doing terribly there. I guess the trade school\nboys have sort of fallen down on us. I suppose that with the\nconquest of Europe you will be without a job in that theatre, or\nwill your organisation out its members into cloaks and masks and\nsend you into the bars and bistros to gather information. If the\nlatter is the case be certain to let me know in order that\nI may apply for duty with you.\nI sned you all my love darling,\nSidney J. Legendre"
