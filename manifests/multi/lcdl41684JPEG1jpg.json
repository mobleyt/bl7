      "value": "John Lynch Columbia March 14th 1860 Dear Brother I suppose Ellen has Kept you posted about the affairs of the convent, but there is another business I wish to ask you about. I recd a notice that the policy of insurance on the old house expires, on the 16th inst M-- it was insured for $4500--($45.--) do you wish it renewed? in whose name? for what time, and for what amt, I think $3000 enough six months long enough, and that the premium should be less-- or are you interested so as to insure at all, please answer and I will act promptly. Ellen tells me Bishop Hughes will stop one night in Columbia, will it be possible for him to stop with us, I would be more than pleased with the compliment, we can very well spare the room, viz the large room for the Bishop, for the two Clergymen, or if you prefer, we can give one of them the room upstairs that you sometimes occupy. We will still have the other [illegible: garreto?] room to spare, so if you can come up at the same time we can have a room for you also, please extend the invitation to the Bishop and his company, to stop with me if it is[End Page 1] only for the night, but if it will not interfere with his previous arrangements we will be gratified by his remaining longer with us, being close to the Convent and Church, he will not be fatigued in vising them, he can thus ride over the town and visit the Asylum Cemetery, & State House, &c &c Tell him to direct the driver to take him to Dr Lynchs, or if you prefer I will meet him at the depot, ([intir?] [next?]) this would be only half the compliment to me, and would be rather on the Dr Gibbs order-- which I do not adimire, but I leave it to you, Practice is improving slightly, more in quality than quantity, but in both, I wish to turn everything to advantage, but in a quiet way, and what better chance of an advertisement than, where did-- stop while in Columbia. Ans-- I did not know &c!-- you understand.-- Excuse this lightness.-- answer about the insurance as soon as possible-- all well, Pray for you affectionate brother John Lynch Rt Revd P.N. Lynch D.D.[End Page 2]"
