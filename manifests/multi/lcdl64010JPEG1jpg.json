      "value": "Beaufort 27th Sept. 1816 My Dear Mother, I receiv'd your letter on Monday last by Bythewood, also the boxes with the articles which you were so good as to purchase for me; I was very much pleased with all of them.- Mr. Heyward is delighted with his Shirts, he thinks them the best that he ever wore [and] the size also [which you requested I'd mention] is very much to his satisfaction. I have sent Anns Packets to the mantua-maker, [and] she promises to have them finished by the time Bythewood is ready to sail, but as there is a great deal of work on them, I am afraid that they will not be finished in time; however I shall do my best [and] send very often, to assist her memory at any rate. I am very much pleased that Mr. Garden gave you such a flattering account of Edward- he is a good judge of his qualities, as they used to stop him almost every morning at Mr. Gibbes's on his way home [and] amused themselves by laughing at his tricks.- little Nat [End Page 1] is as good as its possible, I am sorry that you requested me to give you a description of his beauty, as that is the most unfavorable part of him. its yet doubtful whether his hair will be a bright red, or auburn. his eyes are blue [and] large, somewhat resembling his Papas [and] his nose a true pug, Mr. Heyward says exactly like mine. his complexion is not very good, but with all these imperfections, I am very partial to him I assure you, as he is the best child I ever knew. The account of my ill health is very incorrect, Mr. Heyward has been speaking for some time of going to the Northward the next Summer, [and] I would like to go with him, but I have not felt as well for several years, as I do at present. We were very much surprised at Mrs. Gibbes's returning to Beaufort.- The death of their child must have been very sudden; [and] indeed distressing, particularly to Mr. Garden who we heard was so much pleased at the birth of it. I saw Mrs. Gibbes yesterday, she looks very badly, [and] has a very hot fever every day. A. Elliott is with her. Charlotte sends her love to Elizabeth [and] thanks her for the present she sent her.- Mr. Heyward desires to be remembered to you [and] with my love to all I am yours affect. H. B. Heyward [End Page 2] S Ca Beauft Sept. 27th 1816 Mrs. Nathl. Heyward Charleston S.C. [End Page 3]"
