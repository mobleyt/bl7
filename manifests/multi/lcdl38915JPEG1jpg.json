      "value": "Charleston Oct 21. 1865. Mr T.B Ferguson Dean Hall Dear Sir Your favor of the 17th inst came duly to hand, but owing to the absence of Mr Whaley at Edisto with Genl Howard. I was not able to see him on Thursday, I saw him yesterday and will forward to you on Monday authority to act for us at Dean Hall. His chief in the wood cutting business was in the Office when I called. I informed Mr W. that I wanted the cutting stopped, that it was interfering with my future plans. He gave his man the order to stop cutting instantly. Therefore that business will cease after today. His man is authorized to take to market all the wood already cut and to be cut up to this night which please note. Respecting the payment to Mr Darcy, I have to say that I had supposed you would arrange for it until the 1st [illegible] and made no calculation for it before then. I have ordered Cotton to town for the purpose of providing for this and other day, but it will not be here before the 1st if then. but you can give Mr Darcy the order for the balance due and send him to me and I will arrange with him the day of payt. Mr Whaley has had his lands on Edisto restored and he gave the man referred to above orders for all his [illegible] people to be ready to move to Edisto when the vessel came for them. I will write you again on Monday Respy yours Wm. McBurney [End Page 1] Charleston S.C. Oct 21st /65 [End Page 2]"
