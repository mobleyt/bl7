The lard I am compelled to have as I am entirely out and as you have no smaller quantities, than barrels you will oblige me by sending me a barrel. I do not want as much as that for my own use but perhaps I can dispose of a part of it to some [of] my neighbors. I would also be much obliged to you if you would get me 250 pound of Bacon sides. I would not make the request of you, as you wrote me some time since that you did not have any bacon but I have [illegible: page torn] account at any other house in [illegible: page torn] [illegible: page torn] the cash to pay for [illegible: page torn] if you will be kind [illegible: page torn] it to me, I will pledge [illegible: page torn] that you shall be paid out of [illegible: page torn] Cotton that I send to market [illegible: page torn] Yours [illegible: page torn] M A [illegible: page torn] let me hear from you as early a possible direct to Perry.[End Page 1] Messrs Carhart & Roff [illegible: page torn][End Page 2]"
