      "value": "1977 Inaugural Committee\n\nDear Friend:\n\nThe Inauguration of Jimmy Carter as the 39th President of the\nUnited States has now passed into history. But many Americans\nstill treasure the memory of that three-day period both as a\nhighlight of their own personal lives and as a milestone in our\nnation's history. January 20, 1977, has become, for them, the\nbirthdate of what Jimmy Carter has called \"a new spirit in this\ncountry.\"\n\nPerhaps the most memorable of the many special events that marked\nthe Inauguration was the Gala Concert of January 19, performed on\nthe stage of the Kennedy Center Opera House and televised to some\nfifty-seven million viewers throughout the world. This unprecedented\nprogram was not only a gesture of welcome to the President-elect\nbut was also an expression of solidarity from Americans of\nmany political persuasions.\n\nThis Gala Concert is now being made available by CBS Records in a\ndeluxe record-and-booklet album, proceeds from which will be donated\nto the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1977 alone this\nagency will distribute a total of eighty-five million dollars to\nAmerican arts organizations, communities and artists.\n\nAs Co-Chairpersons of the 1977 Presidential Inaugural Committee,\nwe cordially invite you to relive your enjoyment of President\nCarter's Inauguration through this unusual album. In addition\nto owning a unique sight-and-sound document of a treasured moment\nin history, you will also be actively aiding the arts and artists\nwho preserve and foster the rich tradition of our nation's cultural\nheritage.\n\nSincerely,\nBardyl R. Tirana\nCo-Chairperson\n\nVicki Rogers\nCo-Chairperson"
