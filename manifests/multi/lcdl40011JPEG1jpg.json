      "value": "Savannah March 28th 1840 Revd Dear Sir, I received your letter of the 5th inst. on the 13th to which I would have immediately replied, had I not been so busily employed in making preparations for my interview with Bp. Ives. You are already apprised, I presume, by the Rev. Mr. Spears, of my taking the final step; so that it is unnecessary for me to enter into any detail of the circumstances connected with it. I was introduced to that worthy & excellent prelate by the good Mr. Neufville, and to kind & genial was his reception of me, that I cannot soon forget him. The die is now cast, the last step is made; And need I tell you that, it was after severe struggles & nightly conflicts with my own prepossessions & prejudices that I came to this final determination. My triumph, however, I attribute not to any extraordinary exertions of my own for it has, I trust, been achieved by the power & by the grace of the Holy Spirit, whose light the Lord promiseth to such as seek it with fervor and devotion. You expressed your apprehension that, it would be difficult for me to procure the necessary testimonials of character +c from the members of the Church, to which I hitherto belonged. You will be surprised, therefore, when I inform you that they only seem to vie with each other in manifesting their esteem for me. They have even gone so far as to present me with Two hundred and thirty two dollars, as a token of their regards in which they told me. But this I refused to accept from them. It grieved me not a little to find the two following sentences in your last communication to me. \"There should be, as it seems to me, no secrecy in the step you are going to take. A Christian and, above all, a Christian minister, should be open and candid in his course.\" Dear Sir, if you were circumstanced as I was, you would see the necessity of keeping your mind to yourself until you would come to a final determination. At least I saw the absolute and indispensable necessity of it. [End Page 1] But now as I have come to this determination, be assured that you cannot be more anxious than I am to have the report of it spread far & wide, and wafted, if possible, by the four winds of heaven to every quarter of the globe. Rest assured also that, as it is now taken, it shall never be retraced by the will even for a moment, for it is the result of some years mature deliberation. As to being open and candid, you will, I trust give me credit for both, when you are better acquainted with me than you are at present. Its true, I did not make a confidant of every person by telling them of the doubt that existed in my mind, but situated, as I was, I did not think that either openness or candor required of me to do so. With regard to the persecution, which you say I may look for, and which I cannot expect to escape by any evasion, it awes me not, no matter to what extent it may be carried. It cannot, I presume, extend beyond calumny & misrepresentation, for hapily [sic] we have no inquisitional courts in this land of freedom. And even if there were, they could not compel me to be what my conscience told me I should not be. How much less than shall calumny & slander produce such an effect. No I fear it not, no matter what may be the extent of its malignity. To my God alone I look, and if I can but please him, so far as to induce him to extend his all-protecting arm over me, the most malignant arts of my enemies shall fall harmlessly upon me. As I intend, God willing, to be in Charleston on some day next week, this is, perhaps, the last letter that I shall write to you from this place. Let me, therefore, convey to you, thro' it, my grateful & heart-felt thanks for the deep & continued interest you have taken in me from the time of our first interview, and be assured that the recollection of it shall, during my lifetime, be indelibly stamped on my memory. It[']s true, before I mustered up fortitude enough to introduce myself to you, to open to you my mind, that I entertained doubts & scruples regarding some of the dogmas & practices of the Church to which I belonged. But next to the influence of the Holy Spirit--it is oweing [sic] to the cheering hopes with which you sometimes animated me that, I could make up my mind to depart from her. Have I not then ample reason to be grateful to one, who has been truly instrumental in the hands of God of bringing about a change so important to my present peace of mind & future hapiness [sic]? But, I trust that, that God, whom you & I adore, will reward you for it in a better & more lasting world than this. Try, my dear Sir, to make it convenient to write to me by the next mail, so as that I may be informed, before I reach Charleston, what line of proceedings I must pursue. And that God in his infinite mercy may bless & protect you is the fervent aspirations of Yours, affectionately & devotedly, John Fielding[End Page 2] Rev. J. Fielding March 28th 1840 answer to one of mine--see correspon-- dence Rev Mr. Barnwell Charleston So. Ca. &lt;SAVANNAH GEO MARCH 28&gt; &lt;PAID&gt; [End Page 3]"
