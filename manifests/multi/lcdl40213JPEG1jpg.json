      "value": "Beaufort So. Ca. Aug 16th '47 Dear Mamma, I have been so much taken p lately with going in the country listening to temperance speeches and visiting that I have not had a spare moment to write to you, but as Aunt Martha has probably written to you, I make myself easy on the [illegible] of your anxiety. I am very glad to say that I have not caught the fever & hope that I may escape -- there are few or none cases in Beaufort now -- and unless some prodigious plague breaks out before Friday I have no idea that your fears shall be realized. Papa left for Grahamville today to return on Thursday to take the boat of Thursday night. The town has been in excitement in the temperance cause & the number of signatures is 130. Mr. [illegible] has been exceedingly popular \"& is much elated with his success. George Cuthbert, John Barnwell & a great many have rejoined [?] for 2 years which I hope will be augmented for life. The ladies have come out most famously & not only [illegible] but espoused the cause with great enthusiasm. Aunt Martha & Meta & Smith are among the converts though Uncle George breathes out fire against the cause & vows that neither Aunt B. or Bet shall join. However they are in a[End Page 1] dead minority here & shall harm no one either to drink [?] their [illegible] or drunk [?] their health. Great things have been done & it fully compensated Papa for his trouble. I am very glad that George Cuthbert signed -- for though he is in no danger now -- there is no telling how far he might have been led astray. All here are well. I suppose Grandfather will give you the news -- whatever is worth hearing. Tell Ted that [illegible] & Tallulah have colds -- the mare is dead killed by hard labour & starvation -- but the negroes say collic. Papa preached twice yesterday --& lectured on Temperance to the negroes at night. I will be in Charleston with Papa on Friday & untill then I will remain your absent son RW Barnwell Remember me affectionately to Aunt Mathews & Cos [illegible], RB.[End Page 2] Mrs William H. Barnwell Charleston So. Carolina[End Page 3]"
