      "value": "mail 3 24 43\nrec 3 29 43\n10\nDear Sidney, March 24th '43 \nI received your letter of March 24th this morning telling me\nabout your talk with Tozzer and how hopeless it is for me to land the\njob. I am.truly sunk. It sounds so hopeless. However Col Donovan is dining f .\nwith me next Monday and I am going to see what I can put over. I dont -,\nbelieve Old Fossil T. can last out there very long and I may get out on a new\nsetup. Think the Col. has had wind of our freind on the island,and who knows `\nhe may get the air. I dont feel entirely hopeless about`the matter yet. I shall\nknow more when lssee the Col. and rest assured I will never say anything relative\nto any remarks you have made. I know that would be entirely out of line, anything\nyou say to me is off the record. You know that and need never worry.\nI am.glad to hear you are ghing to \"click\" alright with your new 1 `\nCaptain and I am convinced you two will never be spared away from.what you ar ~\n'doimg. Everyone who comes back from out there say you two are doing a swell ihb.\nBob Thayer was the last to report this. \nAs to news about the Plantation, I cant understand why you have\netc. What we did, how we spent our time riding in the mornimg, visiting\nPlantations in the afternoon.etc etc. The place is now being run by Walter'\nas Boss because Sam did no work, poached the place, and did not even.meand\nthe roofs. Bbngley is comming back to work for us and do carpentry work,and\nI belive it will run just as well that way. I told you the house was attractive\n- the trees lovely, the weather remained fine, we all had a good rest, there\nwere no flowers in bloom anywhere due to the freeze, the place is quiet and\nlonely and must have guests to keep it alive. The trials and tribulations of\naccomplishing anything on the place are so dlfflcult,that the ansver is to\nkeep grass,and try for a garden,and to hell with eve yp ing else. place to\nmy mind not to stay in for 7 months straight but to go to for shorter periods.\nMaybe I am wrong but L dont think there is Farming interest to hold one as\nfarming is hopeless. The value is in the trees which this year have been burnt\nto a frazzle[every inch of the country] but it has still timber value never\nthe less I imagine. I think we should live in a gayer spot. That's my impression.\nTalking of Gayety,i am told Chris Holmes' house s alled the Stork\nClub,and is full of Wine Women and Song. it sound frightfully gay. You have\nnot written me about it. Have you not participated?\nI still await a snapshpt of you and think it incredible Morris\ncan not takethe time or the trouble to dothis for me, I would like it so much.\nHave you received yet the ones of Bo in the blue leather folder?\nI also told you in a Medway letter that miss Finucan did not\nsend you your income tax to sign as your Dank handled the whole matter\nthemselves and they were to send it not her.\nAs to Jeep it was not because he puddled we returned him, lt\nwas because he was too high strung and nervous and crazy, would not eat\nand was thin as a ra1l.Not a good strong healthy cooker with a placid pleasant\ndisposition but one like Linda Lee which we dont want-?\n[End Page 1]\n2\nIt seems hard to find the right type.There is no use walsting ones time and affection\non a cocker that will not turn out the way you expect. I sent him back before ' got\ntoo atttached. \nLandine comes back this week end for the Easter Hollidays. She sleeps in\nf-the other bed in my room and Halle and Hose sleep together also. Its a crouded house\nufto say the least,and I dress in the dark when I go to bed so as not to wake her. I\n~ hope shall find something for her to do in \"ash1ngton, but I dont know any kids here\nHrher age. She told me on the phone last night that she jumped yesterday and leved it.\n3-I think her riding is going alright again now thank god.\nBo is the picture of health and very happy.1 think she is going to be\ne funny like you. \"he really has a sense of humor and loves to tease. I bet she drives\nFQ Landlne crazy some day as she will kid the hell out of her. `\njs Rationing is in now in a big way and giving a dinner party new becomes\n-La very bralny scientific affair. Butter and hard are as rare as caviar and one has I\n,~to plan and flggure and do higher mathmatlcs to work it all out. Rose and Miss Evans\npare busy on the problem all the time. Thank God they are there to worry about it. They\nP are so wonderful those two. They vacume, cook, wash, iron, order and everything. Millie\n'hicooks-and works eight hours a day but not five minutes over time. Its something. I am\n  let me tell you to have a cook.l|Io one can get one who comes to Washington.There are\nnone.\nLester said something about women needed for the Warf's [Womens Airraid\nForce] I think that means'Interceptor Command. If t can get some dope on th1s_that may\nbe another clew to joining you. I refuse to be beaten down by this particularly as\nI told you Admiral Glassford predicts the war will last ten years! I cant stay away \nfrom you that long.I would be dead. We thought the war in Horth Africa was going 0.K.\nbut the Radio London broadcast this morning was far from cheerful. The Eighth Army\nhas been pushed back over all the territory they have Ion and have to start chiseling\naway all over again. I bet it wont be as speedy as we either think or hope.It will\n be tough, tough as hell. Things seem mush brighter out there in the Pacific but still\ndont see how one can do an island to island victory- but then I dont know anything about\nit. What do you think?\n' I am not going to have a birthday as it does n't mean a thing to\ncelebrate birthdays and Xmas withthout you Bes1des I am too old to remember such things any\nmore. 1 have one foot in the grave. I shall wear your lovely pin and think of you and\nwish to God you were with me for a big hug. \"e have  ot to get together somehow. I refuse\nto give un. I am not going to stay on this mainland or the duration While you are out\nthere ifll can possibly find a way. I may go to nightsohool and learn typing if I can\nlive through I5 hours of work a day. I shall see. Others have done it so I suppose I\ncould.\nI guess you will take to Volley Ball now and become experts. Do write\nme all the news. love your letters so.\nAll my love my darling and dont forget I love you mostest, and miss\nyou so much it hurts.\nGertie\n[End Page 2]"
