      "value": "Camp at Purisburgh to J.\nP. G. Feb 1st 1779\n\nDear Sir.\n\nI have the Pleasure of informing you\nthat I arrived in Camp a few days ago after four\nand an half days difficult riding; never surely were\nroads in so bad a Condition, many parts of them so\ntotally impossible that have [illegible] were obliged to\nquit the direct rout and furnish their journey thro' the\nwoods. I found the Army in a State quite un-\nprepared to march, owning to the [fairness?] of Men\nwho had as yet arrived in Camp; neither was\nthere a possibility of [us?] being Reinforced during\nthe Continuance of the bad roads. but I presume\nit will be more agreeable to you to hear of\nour present situation, which has lately grown\nbetter, by an increase of about 1500 Men\nunder Gen: [General] Ash and Colo. [Colonel] [Strickland?]: but even with\nthis addition it does not appear feasible to\ncross the River. Colo. [Colonel] Elbert is Detached to the\nWestward with 400 Men then to Join Col.Hammond\nand Gen: [General] Williamson and collect the Scattered\nFriends of America still Remaining in Georgia\nHis Force it is supposed will consist of 1500,\nor 1800 Men when collected, but to prevent such\nan Union in the back Country the Enemy have\nalready detached a Considerable number and We are\n\n[End page 1]\n\nin [hasty?] Expectation of Receiving Express, some\nintelligence of Importance. It is a great Chagrin\nto us Carolinians whose first Pride and continual\nboast it was, that we have always distinguished\nOurselves by a ready Compliance with Orders that\nwe should find the militia so slow, nay is averse\nto serve during the Campaign, and that is some cases\nthey have shewn how little is to be Expected from\nthem. Tho' I do not charge my Countrymen with\nwant of Spirit; but think that they are deficient\nin that Virtuous Principle which should at\nthis great Critical Juncture animate them to\nturn out and Remain in the field until We\nhave Expelled the Enemy from our Vicinity.-\nWe are just informed that the Militia under\nGeneral Bull, have resolved that if Port Royal\nis attacked that they will Strike the Cannon in\nthe fort and Relinquish the Island: Genl. [General] Moultrie\nhas this day set off for Beaufort; I hope his Endeavours\nmay meet with Sucess [success]. but I apprehend\nthat little it to be Expected from the present temper\nof the People, unless for [Severe?] Laws\nare without delay passed by the Legislature\nfor the [factoral?] Regulation of the Militia\nthe other States of America have been compelled\nto draught their Militia to Serve in\n\n[End page 2]\n\nthe Continental Battalions and by permitting\nthose Gentlemen who were draughted [drafted?] to purchase\nSubstitutes, a good and well Organized\nCorps was immediately formed from the\nlower class of People, who are more willing\nin general to Obey Orders and are more capable\nto endure the fatigues of a Campaign. the\nNorthern States after having Experimented\nmany different modes, [are?] necessitated at\nlength to pursue this letter measure in\norder to Obtain [Pursuits?] and fill next their\nQuarter in the Continental Battalions, If\nthe present disfigured Aspect of Affairs does\nnot Expect some Positive and Resolute Determination\nfrom the House of Assembly,\n[illegible] every little [else?] that We have to do,\nthan to make the best terms possible with\nthe Enemy and submit to their Government. but\nI have a great deal to hope from the Good Verse\nand great Spirit of my Countrymen, which have \nupon many occasions been very Cons[illegible]\nand which is as much, if not more, required\nat Present, than at any other Crisis of our\nAffairs, which the Chance of War have occasioned.\n\n[End page 3]\n\nI hope as the Subject of this Letter is so\ndelicate, in [history?] and important that\nyou will not send it, or any part to the\nPrinters, since we leave from good info[rmation?]\nthat the Enemy have Persons who transmit\nthem such of the Prints as may be necessary\nand intelligent to them. I am Dr [Dear] Sir with\nDue Respect your Obs. Sert [Obedient Servant] and\nAffece. Serv. [Affectionate Servant]\nJohn F. Grimke\n\nPS: Express arrived 300 of the Enemy landed\nat Hilton Head and Count Several [illegible]\n\n[Illegible] A Skirmish lately with the Enemy near\nBayan Creek in the back County of Georgia\nCol. [Colonel] B[arson?] was wounded and 4 of his Men\nwere killed. Our People maintained the\nGround and the Enemy fled upon the above\nloss.-\n\nComps [Compliments?] and Affection to My Mother and Sisters.\n\n[End page 4]"
