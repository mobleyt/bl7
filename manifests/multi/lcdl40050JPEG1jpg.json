      "value": "Galbreths near Newbern Ct House Virginia Sept '4 1845 My dear wife, We have been so constantly traveling that I have had no time to write to you since I wrote at Staunton. Robert has given you on the inside some account of our journey, and as I am very sleepy have only made 36 miles today with a jaded horse I write only a line or two. We had travelled on very comfortably until within a day or two, when on ordering out our horses in the morning they both of them seemed much jaded and one of them slightly foundered. Our impression is that they must have been ridden in the night, as we had rode them the day before only a short distance & very slowly. It has made our journey since rather uncomfortable as we have had to ride very slowly. We think the horse better, & hope to go on our journey tomorrow. We partly expected to meet Mr. [Porcher?] here, who seemed inclined to travel on in company with us. But he has not yet come. It is possible that he we will wait here for him. Mrs. Green's son partly agreed to meet us at Abingdon on Monday next & go on in company but I have heard or seen nothing of him yet. My general health has been much improved[End Page 1] but the stricture on my chest & side still remains. In ascending the Peak of Otter the other morning, I took exercise enough to get rid of every pain & certainly inhaled mountain air enough to heal my lungs if they are sore, but I am not conscious of any decided improvement. I suppose I must have patience & trust in God. Sept. 5th I kept my letter open to say what our prospects are today. They are brighter. The filly is less stiff, & with care, I think we shall get on to Abingdon by Saturday night, where we expect to spend Sunday & partly expect to meet Mr. Green of Columbia. We hope at Abingdon to find a good parcel of letters from home. We have not heard for a fortnight. The last letter we received was the one which I acknowledged in my letter from the Sweet Springs. We feel quite home sick at times but in general are cheerful. Robert makes a very good traveller, and though the weather is very hot, we find horse back agreeable. We expect to arrive at Flat Rock by the 12th or 13th & will remain there several days. After the 12th direct your letters to Pendleton. I will write from Abingdon. God be with you all. Kiss the children for us. Your affectionate Husband W.H. Barnwell [End Page 2] We have not heard from you since we left the White Sulphur but will get some letters Sat. night. Gabreth's House 8 miles from Newbern Virginia Sept. 4 1845 My dear mamma, It is a long time since I last wrote but I have had no opportunity to do so being pretty well tired at night. We went up to Staunton on Wednesday the 24th & the next day we visited Weyers Cave 18 miles from Staunton. We went out and on our way met an Epis. Minister (Mr. Castleman) who told us that we were wasting time labor & money by going by ourselves as we would have no fine view. We however went on and when we had been at the house 3 min. and preparing to go the Cave 2 carriages came up and also a party, consisting of ladies & gentlemen 20 in all in number. We then went to the Cave and after being provided with candles we proceeded and went to the end (about 1/2 miles). I got some stalactites & drank some delicious water. We were in it about 3 hours. I was delighted. We then went back to Staunton having made 36 miles besides visiting the cave. We also visited the peaks of Otter on Monday the 1st and went up to see the sunrise the [walk?] very tedious & the morning cloudy. We were far above clouds. 4000 ft above the sea. The prospect was fine but we only got glimpses of it. We have now rode [372?] miles and our horses we are sorry to say are not well. 1 of them, the mare, is a little foundered. We think they were ridden Tuesday night by some young men & we are obligated to be careful with her. I will write more soon but must stop now. Your affec. son RW Barnwell [End Page 3] [Illegible] Sept. 6th 2 o'clock P.M. I kept the letters open to let you know how we stood the journey thus far. The sun was quite hot, but the filly travelled better than we feared she would do. We walked about the whole 20 miles & expect to go about 14 more this afternoon. Mrs. W.H. Barnwell Charleston So. Ca. <WYTHEVILLE SEP 7 Va.> We wait about an hour to let the heat of the day pass & to rest our horses, & then expect to travel from 3 to 7. Yours Truly, W.H.B. [End Page 4]"
