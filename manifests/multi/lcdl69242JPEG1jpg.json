      "value": "March 1, 1948\nMr. Armant Legendre\n433 Gravier Street\nNew Orleans 12, La.\nDear Armant,\nJust got back to the plantation after a trip\nup to Boston to see about my Drink-O-Mat Machines.\nThey had been delaying shipping them with one ex-\noust after another so I thought I had better find\nout what the trouble was and journey up there.\nFirst I flew from here to Charlotte, North Carolina;\nleaving the plantation at 3:30 in the morning after\ngetting to bed at 2. You can imagine my mental state\nby the time I arrived in Charlotte and met the Fuher-\ner and Sammie Trincher. We did theaters and Drink-\nO-Mat all day. Fired everybody in the North Carolina\nCorporation that had been employed there before and\nhired an entirely new set of managers and office\nforce. Then Morris and I took the night train to\nNew York , rather Morris got off in Washington,and\nI want on to New York, where I saw the head Drink-\nO-Mat office. They had a lot of words for me but\nno machines as far as I could see,so after doing\nsome business of my own I got on the night train to\nBoston and went up there and went to the factory.\nOf course, the New York Office had called the fac-\ntory as soon as they found that I was really going\nthere, and everybody was in a sweat turning out our\nmachines and putting them in boxes saying that they\nhad all along been ready for us, but had just some\nhow delayed shipping them. I stayed there until\nthe machines were packed, and then took the night\ntrain back again to New York. I ran around with\nPatsy all day'and went to Janie's for dinner.that\nnight. This was certainly the most exhausting par\nof the entire trip. Next day I did more work in\n[End Page 1]\n-2-\nNew York buying clothes for Gerry, and then took\nthe night train down to Charlotte. Met Sammie Trin-\ncher in the morning, and we made a round of the mac-\nhines that we had installed. They are doing very\nwell, and I watched one machine ring up 598 drinks.\nThere was a long line of people there waiting to dop\ntheir nickels in. From there, I took the night train\nto Charleston and crawled into bed about mid-night.\nHowever, I read your letter before going ot bed and\ncertainly appreciate everything that you said. The\nonly thing that makes me mad is the social end of it.\nIf you had$100,000,000, you would not really like it.\nYou might like a \"blow out\" on Saturday nights, but \nnothing would ever make you want to go out every night\nof the week and there is not the slightest reason in\nthe world why you should want to. I know I certainly\ndon't.\nI will try and come down around April 20th, be-\ncause as you say these are the times we have the most\nfun. I have been ordered up to Washington for Navy \nduty on March 30th, but believe it only lasts for\ntwo weeks, God Willing, and I might then be able to\ngo straight to New Orleans gathering up the Fuhrer\non the way. Will write you later about the whole mat-\nter as sign shows us what we're to do.\nLove,\nSidney\n[End Page 2]"
