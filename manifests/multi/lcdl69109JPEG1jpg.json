      "value": "December 1, 1942\nGertie Darling,\nIn order that you may check and see whether you\nhave received all my letters I will list the dates on which they\nwere written below. On the first of every month I will send you\na similiar list for the previous month.\nNovember 1,3,5,7,10,12,14, 18,20,28. The long\njump between the 20th. and 28th was when Morris was ill and I was\nso busy. He is back at the office now and it really feels as\nif I am on vacation there is so little to do. He returned yesterday\nmorning and after we had finished the accumalation of the weekend\nI was able to read some of the reports that I had tossed into a\nbig basket. They were very interesting but could not touch\nLife Magazines pictures and story of Guadalcanal. We almost died\nin the office when we saw them as we have been sending the same\ntype of thing out as[\"]most secret.[\"]It really kills me\nto see how everything has to be so secret with us while the rest of t\nthe world is reading about it in the newspapers and magazines.\nWell this is the third time today that I have ripped this\nletter out and done somethi g else. However here I am back again\nwith the news that it is rainXing cats and dggs and has been\nsince early last night. When we came this mornirg it was necessary\nto take twice as long as the water in the streets was up to our hubs\nin many cases, and the c rs were plowing through it like battleships.\nThe navy yard becomes a sea of mud and everyoneis filthy by the end of\na day.\nWent on board a submarine thism rning and was fascinated.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nnever in my life have I seen so many gadjets, wheels and dials.\nall I could think about was what Morris and Sammy Trincher could do\nto mechanism like that during the ocurse of an evenning. It would be\nlike thetimethey took your camera apart or laid the stair c rpet.\nLast night was the scene of a wonderful dinner. We have\na cook book, a very good one tooo de ling only with canned foods\nas the writer wisely says in the beggining that [\"]no man has the time\nto shell peas, slice c rrots or do all the foolish things that women\nthink are neces ary to in order to prepare a simple dinner.[\"]\nFirst we had chicken soup, as they call it in the south, \"fresh out of\nthe can.[\"]Other things[\"]fresh out of the can[\"]were sweet potaotes,\ngreen peas, apple sauce, and [\"]b rds eye[\"]fish. The latter was marvellous\nand although the smell of fish clung to bur hands all evening[,]\nit tasted very good. I think however we should have thawed it out\nbefore cooking as it cooked quite so[L]id and I do not believe ever beca[-]\nme warm, however Morris said this was alright as he has often had\ncold fish with myannoise and this is robably how they cook it.\nI never thought of thatbefore andthing it isa very good idea.\nOne of our men came down[\"]from under[\"]. He had left us\nseveral weeks ago. I hardly recognized him he was so thin. Did not\nhave a chance to talk as he just stopped at my desk, but he is returning\nto the states and of course isvery happy about it. He was very\nfunnny about his job as he was the chief engineer on a ship, and\nswears he does not know one end of an engine from another. Asa\nresult he use to just fish over the sides until a gun went off and then.\nwould dive belwo and show great interestin the engine room.\nI had intended to ask him to see you if he wenc to Washington but he\nsaid there was nto a chance of his going there so did not bother\nto send any messages.\n[End Page 2]\n3\nIt was great fun talking to you over the telephone, and such a \nwonderful suprise. The first thing I knew about it was when I\ncame hme with Morris at four oclock to hear the telephone ringing.\nI debated whtether to answerit or not as I thought it might be some\nman wanting to come out for the eveing and we di[d] not want to see\nanyone. Finally I picked up the receiver and theo erator told me\nyou had beent_rying to telephone all day. I cannot understand this.\nFirst[,]did you wirte me and say that you were going to telephone[?] I\ndid not receive any letter about it. Secondly I was in the ap[a]rtement\nuntil eleven thirty that morning writing to you and then went to\nthe beach to return at 1:30for lu[N]ch. At two thirty we went out in th\ncar to the top of Tantulus and sat there looking at the sea and\nmountains until quarter of four and then returned to the apartment\nas I have said. I do not see how the operator could have missed me\nas she said she had been trying all day and certainly I was there the\ngr[e]atest part of the day. Your vlice w s very clear and except for the\ntimes the operator cut us off I coud he r you perfectly. I have enver\nknown 9 minuts to pass so quickly. I was talking as if you were\nsitting next to me and we were saying what we had done after being\nseper ted for an hourx instead of three months[,]when suddenly she\nwas nine minutes and I re alized that we should have been speaking as\nfast as those men in the radio who tell you everyithing that has\nhappened in the world since breakfast in four minutes.\nLast night welistened to \"Information Please\" It[WA]s very \nfunnny because everything out here is transcribed and the records are\nreceived[A]bout three weeks after the recording. Hence you will hear so\nsome question about whether we will try andland troops in Africa,\nand then a long argument will take place over it, when we know today\nthat troopsare already there.\n[End Page 3]\n4\nWe were told today that we were to move our o[FF]ice to another part of\nthis building. I could not believe my ears. Here we had had telephones\ninsta[L]led special lights, etc. and now they have decided to move us.\nThe building isa wharehouse andtherefor to make an office out of it\nis a very costly procedure because you haveto drill into concrete\nto lead in your wires etc. But that isthe life. As soon as you are\nin one office they move you into another, at least it keepsus busy\nand after the war we will be expert packers. Morris and I can do\nthe administrative end while you , Rose and Jeep can do the actual\nmoving. However I am not taking it to ser ously as I find that an order\ngiven one evening is usu aly co untermanded the next morning and that\nif you put the most urgent papers in your basketfor a a few hours you\nwill find that all specifications have beeen d anged andthat it is no[t]\nlonger urgent, and that you do not have to do anything about it.\nThe man with the drill hasleft our hall and his place is\n[N]ow taken by two wonderful men who peer down the elevator shaft and shout\nto a third man that they have hanging on the end of a rope. Ocassionaly\nthey forget about him and he apparently falls because there is a loud\nthump and much cursing comes up the shaft. Then the two in our\noffice grab hold of the rope and pull a few times and life goes on as\nbefore. Also the stream of men comming ot o r desks asing about\nhammers, chains, spark lugs and radio tubes is increasing daily.\nThe sign intelligence center on the door apparently l res them in with\nthe idea that al last th y will be told where to go.\nGoodhye sweetheart. I will now be able to write you\nregularly again until fat face falls ill again. With all my love.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 4]"
