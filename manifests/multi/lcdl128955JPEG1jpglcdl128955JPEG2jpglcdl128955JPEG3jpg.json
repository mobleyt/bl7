      "value": "333 Kearny St.  \nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.,  Aug. 9th 34\nDear Warren: –\nI received the cards you and Marion sent me from N.O. Thank you for them.\nSince my last to you my health has been so miserable I haven’t felt in the mood for writing but I can’t put off answering yours of June 6th any longer.\nYou didn’t say anything about the receipt of my letter introducing you to Uncle and his family. Did you receive it?\nThe old home on St Charles Ave. was in Jefferson City which was connected with N.O. by a steam R.R. that ran between what is now Lee’s Circle – out St Charles Ave – to Carrolton. Jefferson City was in Jefferson Parish I am sure, because when I was looking up the title to the old home I had to go accross [sic] the river to the Jefferson Parish Court house for them[?] – Orleans Parish now extends to just above Carrolton – When the change was made and this section became a part of N.O. I don’t know.\nThe inscriptions on the tomb – That giving Sister’s birth as “1936” is more or less guess. (over)\nLil wrote me at the time of Sister’s death for what information I could give and she figured out the date recorded with out any absolute knowledge of the facts.\n“Emilie Hubert” – the name and dates were put on the family tomb, but I am certain her remains, like those of Warren, Louise, and Willie were never moved from Natchitoches.\nUncle was not buried in N.O. His remains were taking to Charleston S.C. I remember the circumstance a[s] I met Leonard at the train, when it passed through Montgomery. It was the first time I had seen Leonard for several years and the last time I met him.\nSo the old building at 28 Carondelet St. is still standing – it wasn’t modern 55 years ago – it has made quite a respectable age for an American business building.\nYou didn’t say whether Frank V. Moise was a son of Jim or Everest. Through him, particularly if he was Everest’s son, you might have got a chance to see Uncle’s portrait by Poincie. \nGlad you had a nice trip – I must stop now as I am getting a bit shakey [sic] – \nKiss Marion and the baby for me\nAffectionately\nUncle"
