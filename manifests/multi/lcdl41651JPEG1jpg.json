      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent Columbia S.C. July 27th/59 My dearest Brother, I am very sorry to hear thro' your letter to brother John, that indisposition prevented your travelling. I trust you are quite well now, and have rested awhile - rest is my sovereign panacea. John is so busy that I have not seen him for two days, his little Anna was very ill, but is much better now. Anna and Hugh with Cornelia and Alice Reilly have returned to Cheraw. Ellen Spann and Eliza will go over before the commencement of school, to pay their respects to their Grand-parents. I think they expect you next Sunday. I received a \"Baltimore Mirror\" with accounts of some distributions. I thought probably it would be well to send them ours and the subscription of the following year [End Page 1] What do you think? And so the \"South Carolinian\" did not publish ours! A very good index that they fear our power-It is delightful to make Satan and his emissaries trouble-I am sure it is all for the best. So it is no matter. I was told today that we would no doubt have a flourishing school next year. We will see-I have just paid Miss Cullen $100.00 for teaching painting and drawing for five months!! We will try and void that next year. Our novices studies are in full operation so, as they told you, there is no vacation for us-but time is flying too rapidly. The children too are obliged to occupy themselves much more closely than they anticipated. Our Sisters have several times reminded me to write and beg you to send us the St Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville and New York papers with the various accounts of their Exhibits, Distribution, &c, &c. Hugh and Anna say that persons received their cards too late, and some did not understand them when they got them. So much the better, they will think it more than [End Page 2] it was. Mrs. Bauskett paid us a long visit for the purpose of laying before us all the advantages of purchasing Col Illegible place-which I have since heard is sold- Prudence, forbids my writing something about somebody, and the purchase of our selected spot, which Mr. R thinks should be sold for two thousand five hundred. Shall we continue praying for peace until you tell us to stop, as the miscellany says-or shall we make our thanksgiving? I hope our Holy Father will refuse to accept the donation of illegible. A nun meddling in politics!! I had better say \"good night' for it is pretty late. So give me your blessing please, and Pray for your own Sister Ellen. Sr Baptiste Sup[End Page 3] 27 July 1859 Madame Lynch [End Page 4]"
