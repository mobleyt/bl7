      "value": "Charleston June 12th 1866.  Mr. T. B. Ferguson  Dear Sir.  Since writing you this morning by Mr. Cannon, Mr Edwards handed your letter of this date. He has taken a dozen 14in mill saw files from Huger & Hasels and goes up in the 3 Sisters not having reached town until 10 minutes to 12 [PM?]. These files are similar to the files from Graveleys only 2 in longer and if my recollection is right not quite as fine cut. I will not send the finer cut from Graveleys referred to this morning as these two doz will answer for the present. If your information by Cannon had been as full as by Edwards I think it likely I would have got some one to go with him to Adams Run. Your brother said this morning that the thief would cross the River at Bacon Bridge, and advised that you should go to John Donnelly in the neighborhood of the 18 mile house and offer him $50 to catch the thief or the mule and bring him back he says Donnelly will do it if it can be done- I find there is not a bbl of stone lime in town for sale. Gillespie is now out to see if he can get it from Devereux- if not it cannot be got-Has returned without seeing him  I have concluded to keep Mr Edwards here to send him to Adams Run tomorrow to enquire about the mule  Yours truly  Wm. McBurney"
