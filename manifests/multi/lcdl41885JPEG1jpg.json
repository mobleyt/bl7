      "value": "A.M.D.G. Ursuline Convent & Academy Columbia S.C. Feb 2nd 1864 My dearest Brother, Sister Theresa has asked me to let her write you a private letter, to which I have consented & I only accompany it with a few lines to let you know that we are generally well-enjoying this fine weather & doing finely. At the opening of this session we are losing some & gaining other pupils. Yesterday Miss Pizzini returned from Richmond. Her father told us he had heard several Protestant gentlemen say that ours was the best institution in the Confederacy. Don't you feel proud of having founded--or rather, should have said grateful for having founded it--? \"Deo Gratias for all things.\" [In left margin in longhand] remain M. [illegible] I admire very much her energetic character & so devoid of that silly pride. Pray for your truly affectionate Sister Ellen. Sr Baptista [In right hand margin] Mdme Lynch[End Page 1] You ought to have seen how heartily ashamed I made Miss Mary Mitchel for having taken Sallie away from us & put her at the Methodist College & so pleasantly I did it too. It was really amusing & rich. She is now sorry that she was so precipitate & said she was astonished & pained to see Sally so weaned from her & so attached to the Convent--that she could not stand it! So she took her away before it could go any farther. But I think she will return. A Miss Rhett, about seventeen years of age, has registered her name to enter as a day scholar in a few days & we have received within the last week about $3,000. We have the Daughter of Col Jas Davis of Barnwell & niece of Mrs. [illegible] Ashley Green (name enough) of the same place Coln J.S. Ryan brought them on Saturday. Do you know any thing of a Dr. Cobb who is a convert & wants to send his daughters to us to be prepared for the Sacraments? He lives up on the Charlotte RR. I recd a very satisfactory & grateful[End Page 2] letter from Mr. [illegible] who say that altho' very thankful to us for our kind offer--he never intended to ask a deduction in terms & will pay the whole sum--he will bring again next week when court is over. My hand is so shaky today from the effects of neuralgia that I can hardly write. I miss the ether that I used to relieve myself with by inhalation. I don't believe I have written to you since the death of Abb Hughes R.I.P was known to us. I read the full account & saw the lithographs of the funeral service on a N. York paper. Every thing was highly complimentary & I believe the city [illegible] the expressions of the funeral rites. The biographical sketch was not calculated to excite the admiration of Southerners. When it speaks of his going to France at the request of Seward & succeeding in dissuading the Emperor from acknowledging the Southern Confederacy. What good does all the [illegible] politics do him now?[End Page 3] Bishop McGill says \"What a place vacant & what a pity--for the man called to fill it! may god give rest & glory to the deacon prelate, who wore his panoply becomingly & with great effect & who, in all but his late move in diplomacy, [illegible] well of Catholics in this country. He fought a good fight & I hope has won the crown.\" I like so much this eulogium--I presume all will agree that Abp Hughes has been one of the Master Spirits of his age. When do you intend visiting Virginia? Mr. Pizzini met the ex-jesuit [?] Revd McMullen [?]on his way to Georgetown, or rather to the wreck of that vessel run ashore-- to get a barrel of alter wine which had been presented to Bp McG, if he would send for it. Have you plenty of wine? What has become of the measure of a Cassock, you were to send me immediately on your return to Charleston? Where do you live now--way up town, I hope--I think you'll have to come up to Columbia after all for Miss Cohen tells us the Charleston Library is to be moved up here soon. Home news I do not pretend to give you & John has written so often lately, that I write only they are all moving to the Keitt Place. Mrs. Proctor has plenty of pupils now & will[End Page 4]"
