      "value": "R 5 22 44\nMay 13th\nDear Sidney,\nI loved that description of Armant taking his phisical e xam.\nIs that because he wants to go to sea? I suppose he will do it too if he\nhas made up his mind. I cant understand his not loving Hawaii the way you\nboth do. That heavenly sea with the sunsets, flowering trees and bushes,\nand lovely soft air. You make a wonderful picture of it to read[,]and I can\nalmost visualize how heavemnly it really is.\nI roared with laughter over Henry's tale of woe about the\nplantation. Everything fallen down, broken down and disintergrating.\nWhat a place! Only Mr. Baruch hangs on and goes there. Maybe he has the[s]ecret\nof how it should be handles. I dont know. It sounds like one long lagubrious\nheadache to me. The explosions that cause the plaster to fall, the telehone\npoles rotting, the banks breaking, the bull over worked etc etc. I really\nthought it a very funny letter as I cant possibl[y] immagine being able t\nthink of anything else that could go wrong. Everything about it is wrong\nexcept one thing. It has Beauty- real beauty, the sun comming through the\nmist behind those big oaks on the lawn in the morning, the shadows, the\ndrifting wisps of moss,and the shadows on the house in the evening. I know\nHawaii is far more beautiful and one would soon attach oneself to a new\nhouse. I only feel in my heart how much effort, thought, pain and time I\nhave devoted to that house. The work to get the paneling up, the furniture\nin, the walls painted, the garden built, the vegetables planted. I somehow\nfeel we made an attractive place out of nothing from scratch[,]and if we sell\nit we throw out the window every shred of association of ourselves with Medway.\nIt is sort of hard to explain what I mean. We fixed the smoke house, the\nschool house, the guest house. It was all our idea, a bit of us that took\nyears to get that way. However I am sure I am wrong about feeling anything\nat all about that plac-e as it is not practical, it is desperately expensive,\nit is impossible to keep repaired etc etc. I believ[e]have it as a shooting\nlodge, sell timber off it every year selectively. We'll have a plane and\nfly down there any week end[,]and really have a house with our nice furniture\n[what is left of it] moved to a house that can be kept in repair,in a place\nwhere you can get things done easily and where everything does n't mildew\ndisintergrate and fall apart. Hawaii sounds such heaven to me. It is every\nthing I love most in the world. To live in slacks and shorts, to lie on a\nbeach - to wallow in that water, to live in a house covered with flowering\nvines and to have plenty of sunshine all day long- Yes Darling that sounds\nheaven but I would n't want to be right in a town like Honolulu. It would\nhave to be away wh-ere you dont see other peoples roofs- dont you think so?\nI suppose you dont know the islands around? You know we will all fly which\nwill make life so different to get about.\nAfter days of heavenly spring weather it has turned cold\nagain[,]and damp[,]and dreary[,]and as I am in my office to day SUNDAY working\nas any other day I dont really mind being inside as it is no day for golf.\nHowever the office looks shoddy and dirty to return to this morning and\n[End Page 1]\n2\nI would certainly ra[t]her be in bed and sound asleep. I feel very tired as\nmy assistant is off on a holliday,and this week Ihave had three ten hour\ndays in a row and now Sunday. Well if we can just get the war through and\nover with thats all that matters. You ought to see the way these British\ngirls work. Pan Martin a British Red Cross driver came to dinner last night\nshe had been up since 5 A.M. driving[,]and arrived at 9 c'clock for dinner\nas she had to wait fo[r] a train at a station that came in late. Believe me\nthose girls really work. They all look tired too. When you board a train\nfor anywhere their heads nod and roll[,]and soon everyone in the carriageis\nasleep. I have seen people miss their sta[T]ions unless someone wakes themup.\nThey look pale and exhausted[,]and ofcourse the trains are so crouded it is\nunbelievable. Women do all the station work, call in trains, carry bags,\ntake tickets etc etc. everywhere women in uniform. Believe me its impresive,\nand I never get over feeling it.\nThere is a delightful story about Grosvenor Square[there are\ndozens] but this is a,conversation between Oncle Jo, Winston and F.D.R.\nThe conversation is about teritorial ambitions. To R.D.R. says the U.S.\nhas none,and Winston says \"You promise to give Grosvenor Square back tothe\nBritish when the war is over?\"\n\"An Englishman spoke on Grosvenor Square\" is the take of f\non that poem of \"A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square\". I have no more\nlittle quips for you I am afraid,and no story as good as Armants about\nthe little boy asking where he came from.\nI lunched to-day around the corner at Clar----- and saw\nSerge, Mike Phipps, and alot fo Generals. Had a delicious lunch of fish\npilaf, roast pork ans spinach[,]and plenty of larger beer. I am now back\nin the office but there is little going on as very few people are on board.\nTake care of yourself and get those ribs of yours meanded.\nI dont know how long this good mail service will keep up\nbut lets hope it goes on[,]for it makes letter writing much more fun when\nthye arrive w[a]rm instead of old and stone cold if you know what I mean.\nI always feel I am telling you about things so long in the past that it\nlacks interest. Your letters have such wonderful descriptions in them that\nthey can give one a thrill an[y] time, and I just love hearing from you my\ndarling.\nWith loads of love to you my doodles-\nGertrude S Legendre\nThe kids must be on their way north by\nnow - I am sure they will love\nWatch Hill -\n[End Page 2]"
