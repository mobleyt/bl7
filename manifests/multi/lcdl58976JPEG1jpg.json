      "value": "Mrs. Ian Vaentine, Eastman House, Rochester, New York Dear. Mrs. Vaentine, I have been writing to C. McKim Norton, of the regional plan Associaltion, about a planning problem that we are studying in Charleston, and he now suggests that I write to you  because you have had experience in this fied and experience with an exhibition on plannning. Our planning study here grew out of the desire on the part of a small group to preserve teh best of the old and fine architecture in Charleston and to carry over its best features and benefits into new planning and new buiding. A our study so far shows that preservation of the neighborhoods  and the buildings that are worth saving is dependant upon wise planning for the whole community. We expect to have an exhibition about the first of the year, and we are now trying to find out what exhibition materia is avaiable. Did you include modes in your Rochester show, and idd you have them especiay constructed or did you borrow them. Most of the materia we ahve in view so far is photographic and in the form of statistics and we need others sorts to make it more interesting and ivey. We hope to have a sectionin the show to illustrate the accompishments of planning in other places as impetus to doing something here. Mr. Norton sent me a photograph of a plane in your exhibition caed: \" A Citizen looks at Rochester in January 1941\". Have you photographs which we may borrow for a while to show other sections of your instaation? I want to ask you also about the eafet \"A Citizens\" plan for Rochester\". I assume that it was distributed at the time of the exhibition. would you te me about the response to it, and how the Council operates. Are the open meetings held reguary, or when it seems desirable? \n\n[End Page 1]\nIs the speakers bureau in great demand, and do the Public schoos incorporate study of the city plan into any courses? There is so much that I would ike to know about your set-up and how it is working, but I am afraid that my questions are becoming too numerous. Any and a information that you can send me I will greaty appreciate. Sincerely yours, Secretary, planning Committee\n\n[End Page 2]"
