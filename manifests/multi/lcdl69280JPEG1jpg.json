      "value": "May 14, 1943\nDeer Gertie, \nI received your letter mailed on the seventh this morning. This\nwas the first letter I had received in a week as I hed received your last\nletter on the seventh of this month. Naturally I was delighted to hear from\nyou, but could not underttand your remarks about being stuck in Washington\nall Summer. I thought everything was fixed for you to join the Waacs, and\nthat you were leaving shortly to go to a camp and become a colonel. Won't\nyour organization give you permission to leave. I was under the impression\nyou had arranged everything in sinister fashion at a tea party where you\nhad brought the heads of the Waacs and your own Boss together for the\nfinal details.\nCouasin Annas Ewing death is a crime. He and she were such lovely\npersons, I liked them so much and am genuinely sorry that they are gone. I will\nalways remember them in him sorrounded by their children and grand children\nfor when they lived and breathed. I suppose their lives were very hap y ones,\nmore so than many others in that they gave so much pleasure to others. Y ou\nwere wonderful to go to the funeral as tired as you are sweetheart, and I admire\nyou for doing so.\nDinner at Polly's is of course like stepping into another world.\nThe war, servants and money problems are dropped behind and all that is gold\nglitters and all that glitters is gold.A real \" let them eat cake if they\nhave no bread \" world. I could take a little of it now myself. From your\ndiscription of her summer I gather and am confirmed in my opinion that America\nthinks the war is won, and that only the drones will continue to work and\nslave at their jobs. I wish that I could depend on their hopes. You said\nyou were the only Sanford present and it raised the question in my mind\nwhere Laddie is now. Has he been sent abroad or is he still in the States.\nAnd what of Mary , is she with him or has she taken ajobh. I have not heard \nanything about them and hope they are well.\nI think your idea of the children going to New Orleans is a brain\nWave and very fine. However I do not know whether they will have enough\nservants to handle Miss Evans and two children end whether they will be able\nto get them. You see Olive has never run a house like that before where\nshe has white nurses with trays and so many children not her own. However\nif she will take them[,]which I think she will it would be wonderful for them\nto see Southern life and a different way of living. Landine will hate it,\nthat I can promise you. You will receive letters that there are no nice\nchildren etc. It will do her a hell of a lot of good, I think and hope.\nNo leave is being granted to anyone out here unless they have a\nreason like their Father, Mother and Wife dying and no one to settle the\nestate. Then you are given ten days to go back[,]and [are] admonished that you had\nbetter not miss the boat either. However I hear gossip to the effect that\n[End Page 1]\nafter two and a half years servcie in the island you will be given leave, so in\na year and four months or rather a yea[R] and ten nonths I will be knocking at\nyour door.\nI go to the hospital every day and see Morris during my lu[n]ch hour.\nHe is feeling about hhe sane, although the doctors say there is nothing wrong\nwith him. They have taken a test of his blood and a cardigraph of his heart\nand everything appears to be in working order. I sup ose he is just tired as\nthe doctor told his that at forty you have to begin taking care of yourself\nand stop working when you are exhausted as you will only do damage to your\nhealth it you keep on. It is very funny when he is not here as I am handling\nhis affairs as well as my own. You would apprecaite the situation if you could\nsee it after the [scratched through] we s ent in the little office at Medway with the\npapers heaped on the desk. I think Morris will be a[L]lowed to leave this Sunday\nand will than stay in bed at the apartment for a few days before returning to\nwork.\nYour discription of the country with the wind blowing and the blossom\ninx the trees was lovely . I reme ber well how superb those blue ridge\nmountains were when we motroed there last fall a year ago. How they flamed\nwith color and we thought what a wonderful place to live. Do you remember\nthe funny old house we looked at with the enormous old rooms and staricase\nthat the women assured us floated. It had vey short rises to the steps and\neven I was able to go up without puffing. Outside there were quaint bu@1nge\nand a wonderful old kitchen. We discussed how wverything should be done over\nYou know I think the greatest pleasure in new places is the discussing of how\nit should he done over , and not the doing over or acutally living in the\nhouse.\nMy back it Ok again and the world is very fine. Today the sun is\nshinning after a stormy night and pouring rain. There is a freshness in\nthe air, and a clxeaness[,]so that the mountains stand out and the cane in\nthe fields stretching to the distant ridges seems very green. I would like\nto be riding ahorse in bracing autmn air and smell the smell of wood smoke\nand damp leaves. You would like to be smelling salt water, and see the\nbreakers curl on the beach, and feel hot sun on your back and roll onover\nslowly stretching and gurgling with pleasure at doing nothing in a lovely\nplace. Perhaps some day we will he able to.\nGoodbye darling, all my love goes to you.\nSidney Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
