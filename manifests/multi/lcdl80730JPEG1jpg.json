      "value": "Burlington 12th September\n\nYour last letter my beloved Brother was received on\ntuesday and need I say that your high approbation and increased affection\nmore than repays me for any past privations and sufferings \nalready [illegible] founded by the [illegible] of my Creator and ardent attachment\nand almost painful gratitude exhibited by our departed Servant.\nOf the Last hours of his existence I have wished [our savior?] that existence\n[indeed? succeed?] to send you a particular account, but I have delayed doing\nso because I hoped that in a short time I should be able to look back\nfor the event without that sensation of agony which at first accompanied\n[introspection?] so painful but it is too recent yet to be recounted\nwithout [many?] many tears and [John?] induced to undertake it now\nbecause I will not permit a selfish feeling to deprive you of the melancholy\nsatisfaction of reading my statement. In my letter of the 8th\nI informed you what an alarming change had taken place without\nany apparent reason, The [illegible] which [illegible] him was violent and\nlong one. [Jane?] persuaded that Death had then stricken his victim I\nessayed every art to restore warmth but without effect until I administered\na little Sprits of water as hot as it could be borned taken shortly\nafter this he fell asleep and slept as quietly for two hours. I watched by him\nwith all the anxiety of affection and awaited his awakening in the hope that\nhe would be better but alas it was far otherwise he started and [in my?]\nincoherent wandering [expressions?] escaped him, in all of them how\ntenderly he spoke of me. I ever shall remember I was deeply distressed\n\n[Cross writing]\nextinct at length that [pressure?] ceased the motionless hand was covered with the dew\nof Death and the strained ear could no longer hear any symptoms of existence. Mrs\nFraser returned to the apartment but I spoke not, I moved not, I was [illegible] with\nfeelings I cannot describe on the lifeless lady before me, but I was roused by the accounts\nof kindness which entreated me since it was all over to leave the room I\nclosed with my own hands those eyes which had so long looked on me with tenderness\nand helped those [less?] which were wont to bless my down [nothing?] and my up rising.\nThe rest of this night passed alone and spent in thanking\nmy Creator for the mercies he had shewn me in enabling me to do my duty\neven to that dreadful hour and in fervently acknowledging that since no prospect\nof recovery remained it was a mercy to put an end to sufferings which augmented\nday after day until even he who loved him almost wished for Death\nto crow with the reward which can only be attained thro [through] this medium such\nexemplary patience and Christian resignation. I have often heard persons say that\nin the first moments of affection Religion could not exercise its power but for\nmyself I can truly say that I felt its sweet influence at the very moment I was\n[readying?] my Parent and my Friend The next evening I visited the chamber of death\nand took a last farewell of the remains of one so dearly loved. I knelt beside the\ninsensible body, remembered the lifeless form and hoped the day [could?] [delay?] I prayed\nfor Fortitude to sustain the trial yet in store for me and God has decorated me such\nmercies as will be matter of rejoicing for ever. The following day I attended the  \n\n[End page 1]\n\nby the visible alteration which I observed but I said nothing and endeavoured\nto relieve the sufferings I could not avert, as I sat beside him he exclaimed\nhelp me and extended his hand I instantly raised him up and\nwas terrified at the gasping for breath which had thus suddenly [assayed?]\nhim, it was long ere the restoratives I offered procured any relief and I\nadministered them in an anguish of mind I cannot permit for every moment\nthreatened to put an end to existence at length respiration became\neasy and he sunk into a state of almost torpor while this continued\nhe retained a perfect consciousness of every thing and in accents [handy?]\nand [able?] offered up a prayer to that God in whom he trusted, Sleep\ndid not visit his eyes that night and on the following morning the alteration \nbecame [illegible] more perceptible Sunday was passed in much\nsuffering and I cannot describe to you what I suffered for in addition\nto the certainty of soon losing my beloved Parent was the misery of beholding\nhis agonies without the power of relief indeed of increasing them\nfor I could not move him without inflicting pain, I was so much occupied\nby him that I did not go to Prayers at the usual time he reminded\nme of it and begged me to unite with him in asking that\nsupport and mercy which we both needed as much, I did so and when\nI had finished went to the bed he threw his arm around me as I\nleaned over him and drawing me to him helped me and blessed me then fervently\nentreated God to bless his Child and reward her for her goodness\nto him. He will bless me my dear Father I said for the prayers of the\nrighteous are the sweetest kindness that can be offered to him. The night\nand day following he suffered much very much but not a murmur not\na groan escaped him his [reorgination?] and his patience seemed perfected\n \n[Cross writing]\nfuneral the service now performed in [illegible] manner then it is in\nour churches a part of it was read and then as discourse delivered after which\nthe [illegible] appoints the rest of it was read at the grave, thither I went and\nbeheld all that was easily consigned to its native dust, and I sorrow not as one without\nLife But trust that if I finish my promising faith I shall meet my [departed?]\nPresent In Heaven- [Adieu?] my dearest Brother Remember\nme affectionately to all the family and Tell mama to use no painful effort to\nwrite to me I am indebted to Sally and the Girls and will write soon but\nmy eyes are sometimes quite painful-\nYr Affy [Yours Affectionately] S.M.G [Sarah M. Grimke]\n\n[End page 2]\n\nand Petitions for mercy and Fortitude wer incessantly mingled with\nThanksgivings and Praise. Towards evening he said to be How merciful\nis God who with so much suffering and such long and severe trials\nhas given me strength to bear them and filled me for the mansions of\nbliss by with drawing every earthly enjoyment and teaching me to love\nhim above all things, I feel satisfied that when I pass there the dark\nvalley of the shadow of death his rod and his staff will comfort me\nI am sinking he continued very fast but let this [aforesaid?] console you.\nI could not reply emotions prevented utterance, I continued to sit beside\nhim and administer a beverage to quench the thirst which consumed\nhim, an application of Laudanum had relieved his pain [illegible]\nI had placed every thing comfortable, I took my seat beside [illegible]\nlooked at me [illegible] and said you must not fatigue yourself by watching\nI replyed that I could not leave him at least until he slept, a faint\nsmile illumined his face for a moment as he fervently said. Oh God\nhow sweet to sleep and wake no more, his last prayer was uttered but\na few minutes ere it was answered, he put one of his hands round my\nneck as I bent down and with the other pressed mine, his pillow was supported\non my lap, and he seemed then satisfied; at his request the candle was taken \nfrom the room and shed uncertain and gloomy light through the\napartment from the passage, but I wanted not light to tell me that\nthe awful hour of dissolution was near, Mrs Fraser had left the room\nand alone at the hour of midnight I watched the fatal indication of\napproaching Death, my eyes were freed or that face whose heavenly\ncalmness seemed to say I sent in peace, a gentle pressure of my hand\nand an almost imperceptible respiration alone proved that life was not \n\n[End page 3]\n\n[To:] Thos.

No provisions have been made for winter\nclothed at Belmont.- It was our intention when we went to Mr. y.-\nto purchase some trifle as presents to the family, Do you think I am at\nliberty now to lay out any money in that way. My Father was very liberal\nto me and constantly [illegible] me to purchase every thing I wanted and I shall\nregret it if those for whom he destined his gifts do not get them. I believe\nafter paying a visit here I shall go back to Mrs. F. as she seems\ngratified by my society. [She?] has given up the idea of travelling-\n\n[End page 4]"
