      "value": "Beaufort March 5th, 1839 I merely intend writing you a few lines dear William to inform Catherine and yourself that I expect, if it is Gods will to come to Charleston in the next trip of the Steam Boat, accompanied by Mary Gray; I also expect to have the company on Board of Caroline Seabrook, Cousin Mary, Elliott; and Matilda Maxcy as far as Edisto, Henry Stuart I understand is also to be on board, so that should any thing occur to prevent you meeting me at the Wharf, do not let it trouble you, merely send Alick. I have seen all of our friends here they are [illegible] well, and enquire very kindly after yourself and family. Osborn came to see me a few days ago, he appeared to be very anxious for your visit to Myrtle Bush, and Mr. Walker says he thinks he can come and preach at least one Sunday for you. I hope you [be?] able to come on Sister Betseys account as she longs very much to see you, she is tolerably well Not better and the rest of the family well. Mr. Richard Johnson preached all day on Sunday for Mr. Walker very good sermons I trust they may be blessed to the people, they have great privileges, and of them much will be [regained?] I heard from Robert on Friday last, they were all well but little Mary, he was very busy as he had commenced a new [Study?] with the Juniors.[End Page 1] I copy from his letter a piece of information which you ought to be [acquainted?] with, if you have not already heard, and which I prefer should precede [illegible] to [illegible]. \"You have probably heard since your arrival in Beaufort of Stephens engagement to Charlotte, I never had the least suspicion of it until after my last letter to you. Eliza informed me, that she heard from the girls some private understanding existed between them. Neither of them have ever spoken with me on the subject, but they are certainly engaged. I was of first much surprised - but I believe he has chosen wisely. It cannot be without any painful associations that any of us learn this intelligence for the first time, but we have cause to be very grateful, that the choice (certainly very reasonably to be expected) has fallen on one so worthy, and so well known, and well loved by us all.\" I now feel I must say a few words, and I trust they may prove most satisfactory to you that you would [have expected from?] me under those circumstances, it is the Grace of God not [illegible] [illegible] for it. I was not altogether unprepared for this event, for I have [illegible] Stephen would marry again, and thought Charlotte likely to be the person as he [admired?] her character very much, I have therefore prayed much to believe it [illegible] [that at?] the end of one year he should have desired it, I did not think, neither that [illegible] myself especially, who was [illegible] confidential [terms?] with him, should be kept in ignorance of it is Charlotte M [Faber?] [mentioned the report to me?], I said nothing, and [he appeared?] then to recollect himself, as it was [evidently?] [illegible][End Page 2] on board of the Steam Boat Miss Edings asked me if it was the case. I answered no, thinking Stephen certainly never would have allowed me to hear it from strangers. I think my God [has?] enabled me to make [illegible] prayers to him, that I may be satisfied, and I'd truly think [illegible] [illegible] the next [illegible] I should have felt there was no cause of complaint, and [illegible] for thankfulness, for how could I object to Charlotte. [Illegible] [Illegible] had heard it from Dr. Fuller, who learnt it from others the night before I came, but said he could not [illegible] tell me a [illegible] account whilst I [illegible] [illegible] either that we were [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] I [love?] Stephen, that one great [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] of me, is that he should have asked so -- I feel as if it [illegible] [illegible] brother that had done it as well as my brother-in-law [illegible] [illegible] no [illegible] of resentment, and I trust [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] make me [illegible]. I carried this care to my Savior at his holy table, and I trust he heard [illegible] prayer -- but I [illegible] myself [illegible] [illegible], and request your earnest prayers on my behalf. I do not wish to [illegible] on this subject [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] me, but if God [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] for me, I [illegible] I am [illegible], I [have?] thought all [illegible] of [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] is the same. May i wish this but satisfied and [glory?] in thy name but I am a slow learner, and need many heavy [strokes?], but it is [illegible]. [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] gives the [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible]. Sister Betsey sends her love. With much to Catherine and a kiss to the dear children I remain[End Page 3] Your affectionate Sister Ann Barnwell To, The Revd William H Barnwell Charleston South - Carolina [center of page] 1839[End Page 4]"
