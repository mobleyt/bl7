      "value": "THE CIVIC SERVICES COMMITTEE  OF THE Carolina ART  Association  The Carolina Art  Association has in the past taken active  part in civic planning development. The Associaltion\"s present participation in community planning through Its Civic Services Committee is by way of living up to past tradition. The Civic Services Committee was organized in the spring of 1940 to study community problems [other .than those of Public health, charity  or industry] and to get action on them by the following method:.  1. Assembe the actua facts pertaining to these problems.  2. Present them to the Public, and get the reaction of  the Public to the\" facts.  3. On the basis of these findings, consult with a planning engineer of national reputation, who Is working  with the  Association  4. Ascertain whether or not there is Public endorsement  of the proposals arrived at.  5. Present these proposals to the proper authorities,  with the weight of wide-spread, organized Public  opinion to support them  6. Whenever possible and feasibe, persuade the authorities that there is sufficient Public sentiment behind  the plan to warrant their taking definite action on it.  The  Association believes that:  1. The people are thinking aike on many community problems these days. \n\n[End Page 1]\n-2-  2. The city authorities are interested in knowing what  the sentiment of the people is in regard to these  problems.  3. A satisfactory solution to these problems can be  reached if a medium is created whereby Public opinion  can be [a] gathered, [b] anayzed, and [c] presented  coectivey to the authorities.  The above is specificay the purpose of the Civic Services Committee. Its membership is of necessity not large,  since it is a consuting, planning and advisory group. However, for the express purpose of making this group representative of the  interests of the community as a whole, the  membership of the Civic Services Committee and its working  groups has been drawn from sixty welfare and service organizations within the city.\n\n[End Page 2]"
