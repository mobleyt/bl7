The \nreport of it was in several respects er-\nroneous and imperfect.  I would be \nglad to have it published from the \ncorrected copies by our papers.  \nThe speech will give you my views \nfully on the war, and the consequences if \nit is to go on, [and?] [makes?] up the issue \nfully, between conquerers and subjugates \nand a defensive line.  My object in \noffering the resolutions was to present \nthat issue directly to the country, so \nthat it [may] be deliberately [dreaded?] \nby the people, [illegible] they will take.  \nI shall call my resolutions up, as \nsoon as the Army bill will permit,  \nand force them to a vote if I can.  \nThe issue is one of the greatest ever pre-\nsented to the country; and, I do hope, our \nstate will be found on the side \nof liberty and our free institutions; \nand North Charleston will take the\n\n\n[Page Two]\n\n\nlead in giving the impulse in the right \ndirection to the state and the South.  I \n[trust?] its [people?] will be united on \nthe occasion.  If such should be \nthe case, the present [dangerous?] [peril?] \nof [aggrandizement?] [may] be [ended?] \nand the country and its institutions sound.  \nI am [more?] satisfied that all the \nNorth is opposed to our having \nany part of Mexico.  The movements of our \nstate and any [resolutions?] have [filled] \nthe Proviso; [but] it is neutral to effects \nthat is [illegible] as [clearly?], by a \n[circurations?] [illegible]. The present \nscheme is, to give the Mexicans, who we \nhave conquered, the forces to [concluding?] by \nforming them into territories.  It would \nbe a sad result of our valor and sa-\ncrifice to be deprived of their fruits \nby the very people we have conquered, and \nto lose at the same time our [illegible] \nas members of the Union; [illegible] get [illegible] \nI [apprehend?] will be the end.  I hope \nto have some say [?] of writing to the \n[senate] my views on the present state \nof the [abolition?], [illegible], in reference \nto this aspect of the \n[Page Three]\nsubject. \nTruly\nJ. G. Calhoun\n[H. M. Cowan Jr.?]"
