After\nwe had spent Six days in that Neighbourhood [sic] in\nvisiting our friends I was Seized with a hot nervous\nfever, which confined me to my bed for two Days.\nThe third day finding the fever somewhat abated\nI got into my Carriage and after much fatigue\nget to Beverwyck. This Journey had the good\neffect to produce an intermission, which Dr. [?]\ntook the advantage of, and by his good manage-\n-ment after two fits, has totally Subdued my\ndisorder. I am still in a state of convalescence,\nbut have so far recovered as to be able to pay a\nvisit to Mrs. Lott [and] Mrs. Livingston, now at Colo. [Colonel]\nAbeels' where the later expects momently [sic] to\nbe brought to bed, and upon which Account her\nmother attends her. And I hope you will place\nmy long Accou Silence to the Account of my late\nindisposition and not to inattention –\nThe fare as mentioned by you, that you\ncan give Mr. [von] Beverhoudt and me, would\nbe perfectly agreable [sic], and we should most\ncertainly have been with you if your Quarters\nhad been more accesable [sic] to Gouty feet [and] Limbs,\nbut as Mr. Beverhoudt would make but a poor\nfigure in the rough Grounds you at present\noccupy, we have thought it most prudent to \npostpone\n[End Page 1]\nPostpone our intended visit until you get into a\nmore hospitable country; tho we both wish to See\nthe works at Westpoint, which after the labor\nexpended thereon, we conceive must be very formidable.\nIt is with great concern that I am informed\nby you of the Indisposition of Mrs. Greene [and] the\nTwo children. If Mr. Beverhoudt [and] family had\nnot arrived, it would have afforded me a very\npeculiar pleasure, if Mrs. Green had spent the\nSummer with us, and the more so, as I fondly\nflatter myself she would in my family have\nescaped the disorder she labors under; but I\ncan only wish for the present; It may perhaps\nbe hereafter be in my power to carry those\nwishes to effect. I sincerely wish she may\nreceive benefit from her Journey to the\nEastward, and hope soon to have those wishes\nconfirmed by you.\nThe Report you had about Admiral\nArbuthnot's arrivel [sic] has proved true, but from\nEvery information I have received from the other\nside of the Water, they the Reinforcement he\nhas brought will not create much new trouble\nto you – Indeed if the Report we have about\nCompt [Comte] D'Estaing's coming on this coast with\na formidable fleet and armament proves\ntrue, I am not without hopes, but we\nmay Kidnap Sr Harry [Sir Henry Clinton] [and] the admiral in\nNew York – My wishes in this respect I must\nown are extravagant, but hope they are \nnot\n[End Page 2]\nnot altogether Chimerical – Certain it is\nthat their completion is desirable, and more\nparticularly so to the poor New York Refugees,\namong which I cannot help Remembering my-\nself – \nThe Enemies Retreat from before\nCharlestown must in its consequences operate\nas a Defeat, and in the Eyes of the neutral\nEuropean powers, appear much more\ndisgraceful – Would it not be a clever thing\nif Compte D'Estaing took their whole fleet,\n[and] army in Georgia? – Such a thing is not\nimprobable; nay it is founded in sound reason\nthat he should make a sweep of that weak\npart o the British possessions before he attempts\ntheir more Strong holds in and about New York\nThe Exploits against Stoney point [and]\nPaulus Hook are glorious [and] will not only rank\nthe Conduction thereof high in the annals of\nAmerican faire, but hold them up to all the\npowers of Europe, as the bravest of men, who\nhave executed arduous talks with less bloodshed\nthan any undertakings of the same nature we\nhave any accounts of; and it will also convince\nBritain that she has no Poltroons to contend\nwith, but with a people Virtuous [and] who\ndare to risque [sic] every thing in defence [sic] of their\nmuch injured rights and priveledges [sic].\nThe Success of General Sullivan, will\nteach the Savages, and their more Savage Allies \n[and]\n[End Page 3]\nand leaders, that it will be their wisdom to\nlive upon friendly terms with the United States\nof America – They have always been accustomed\nto carry fire [and] devastation with them in all their\nwarfare; they will now experience the effects\nthereof, and thence be cautious as they find\nthey are not out of the reach of the arms of\nAmerica, how they the Injure our out Settler,\nagain – The Penobscott [Penobscot] Expedition I find\nhas failed to the great damage of the Eastern\nTrade, for which I am sincerely sorry; but\nperhaps good may come out of Evil – The\nEastern States were so intent upon navigation\nand making money that way that they almost\nforgot the Army – This Stroke may remind\nthem of their Duty, and [?] them more\nto assist in the General cause- At least I hope\nthis may be the case.\nI am much obliged to you for your\nfriendly hint about Col.o [Colonel] Livingston [and] so is he\nand doubt not he will benefit by your advice\ntho' I believe there is much more Smoke than \nfire the few articles he has had out are very\ntrifling; yet it is imprudent in him to let ever\nthis Little leak out [and] make a noise\nMrs. Lott Mrs. Livingston [and] Colo. [Colonel] Abeel's\nfamily I am in respectfull Salutations\nto you [and] all friends with and about you\nwish Dear General\nyour faithful hbl. Servts [humble Servants]\nMaj.r Genl. [Major General] Greene Abrm [Abraham] Lott\n[Endorsed on left margin:]  From Abr. [Abraham] Lott 18 Sepr.\n1779\n[End Page 4]"
