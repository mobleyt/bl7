      "value": "R 5 26 44\nMay 17th '44\nDear Sidney,\nI notice on your letter on May 1st that you have written\nLt. Comdr. in the corner. You have never mentioned being promotedto\nan other stripe. GONCRATULATIONS! Did all the Legendre boys get pro-\nmoted together? There must be many a bit of boasting if it did n't \nhappen all three of you at once. When actually did this go through?\nI know how slow the Navy is in ever promoting anyone so I am duely\nimpressed, and so pleased for you. Congratulate Brother Morris and\nBrother Armant for me also.\nDarling never mind about the bathing suit. I would much r\nrather have the ear rings and as it is winter here again and there is\nabsolutely no hope of a swim unless I get to the French Riviera next winter-\nit is honestly not worth while. I dont go to the country any more as one\ncan not travel anyhow, so there will be no opportunity to use one.\nI am so pleased for you that you are enjoying yourself so\nmuch. The party at the outrigger sounded heaven. I just cant immagine\nanything more perfect than being out of doors under the moon near the\nsea , and listening to soft sad Hawaiian music. It is from an other\nworld not this on in 1944. It hardly seems possible or real to me.\nHow lucky you are with no balck-out, and that perfect climate. I suppose\nyou adore it, and have some heavy\"blond\" who loves you very much.I dont\nmean hevvy in pounds but only in weight of affection. Well I guess a\nplace like that without a gal is impossible. I hear Morris has a very\n\" heavy\" one wso is nuts for him. I cant blame them[,]for the gals out there\nhave probably the two most attractive men in the world to play with, and\nhave had them both for nearly two years now. Well this spot is not quite\nsuch a romantic setting,as you can picture. One drinks too much, works\ntoo hard, and gets air -no_t at all, but all this wont last forever lets\nhope, and some day this nightmare will be behind us.Anything to win this\nd--- thing is the way I look at it.\nI know we have been on the \"brink\" of invasion for months\nand months,and I dont blame you for thinking that the navy will get to\nIndia and France by the Pacific way before we get going, but hold every-\nthing it is sure to come off some day in the future[,]and lets hope its a\nhowling success.It has got to be.\nCharlie B. turned up yesterday back from an other paint\ntour[,]and is off somewhere else again to-day on an othe[r] rassignement. He\nmakes me laugh so, and I love to see him turn up. He just leaves his laundry[,]\nand is off again. He is breathless with enthusiasm over his life and every-\nthing he is doing, and I do not believe anyone has a more interesting time\nof it than he in this whole theatre.\nEllen Frazer the angel, has sent me some gay colored silk\ndresses she picked up in P.B. from Tat Saunders[,]and I have got quite a\nkick out of them. \nRose sent me a c_olapsable umbrella that is a jem, and such\n[End Page 1]\n2\nfun to put up and down. I keep meaning to buy Landene a birthday present\nduring the lunch hour but somehow so far have not got around to it. One\ntries to do so much during the lunch hour, pick up cigarettes at P.X.,\nget a shampo, eat, shot, etc etc. and consequently one gets nothing done\nat all. Nothing opens till 9.30 and everything shuts at 5 P.M. so one misses\nout all around.\nYou must be growing to terrific proportions to have to\nmove into a still bigger building.Are you becomming a very importent cog\nin this great big wheal? I am a very rusty one, but our slogan is\"We give\nour all every hour on the hour for Eisenhower\".\nI am so gald your little Jap cook is such a success and\nfeeds you so well. I know what a difference it must make after so much\ndog food and canned goods of Morris' choice. It's so much better for your\ndigestion to have a nice hot meal. It sounds so perfect breakfasting on\nthe terrace out of doors[,]and you dont know how I envy you. It all sounds\nto good to be true. What I want more than anything is out of doors and\nsunshine[,]and when this is over no one will even find me in doors for a\nminute, not even at a desk long enough to sign a check. Whe[n] I think how\ngrim and dark I used to think the School House was down at Medway - it\nmakes me laugh. That was gay in comparison. I now keep a big vase filled\nwith lilacs and spring flowers on my desk to cheer me up, as I pass a\nflorist every morning on my way to the office.\nI am still looking for an other flat with no success. I\nam mean enough to hope my landlady will[not]be able to obtain passage back\nto this the[a]tre. It may prove that I am right too.\nMy Big Boss is here but I have not seen him yet. He may\ndine with me next week which would be fun. Serge saw a man who saw Janie[,]\nand she is evidently O.K. somewhere. Thats all the news I know.\nLaddie is in Mexic_o City visiting the President with\nMary. Winston is a marine private at Paris Island, and is devorcing Helena.\nSo long darling, take care of yourself. You did not\nmention your ribs in your last letter so I hope they have meaneded by now.\nLove-\nGertrude S Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
