      "value": "M 6 24 43\nR 7 1 43\nJune 22nd\nDear Sidney,\nI contacted Clarence off to-day to see if there was any let\ndown on Naval restrictions that might permit me to get to you. The answer\nwas none. It appears the only chance is if you own property out there and are\na resident. I strongly suggestthat you buy a nice bungalow, become a property\nholder and send for me. There may be a way that way, and that way only.\nI wanted to make good and sure I was n't off in the wrong direction. I am\nslated now to leave for the Ivy. Ofcourse I dont know when or on what., but\nI think it may be on a\"queen.\" I have told Rose of my appraoching move[,]\nand we are now in the throws of finding a light trunk to squeeze all my p\npossessions into,as one is allowed 175 lbs. including all. I am planning to\ntake plenty of warm clothes, lipsticks and stockings which you cant buy there[,]\nand will probably stay at Claridges. Write me [percent] American Embassy as it is next\ndoor to where I work. American Embassy -Grosvenor Square. I doubt it I\nget off before three weeks from to-day but you never know. I am telephoning\nyou to-night. The mails are so punk now the letters dont get ehre for long --\nspells. Your last was June 10th. They never come airmail anymore.\nBe sure and send me a cable if you change or move or anything.\nThe American Embassy will always reach me. If you get leave for god sakes let m\nme know at once because I would want to return emmediately to Washington\n- and can do so. Dont think I would n't[,]believe me. I canr_esign anytime and\nbesides - it would be a \"trasfer\" not resignation anyhow. Being a civilian I\nam free as air,and passage home is easy by comparison to passage over.\nThe strikes and Race riots are so discourraging it makes you\nmad as hell. It hardly seem conceivable it can happen. I am sure they are axe\ninspired. They must be.The war front news is so good it makes you sick to have\nthe home front news so lousy. I shall be thrilled to get closer to what is\ngoing on,even though my heart is in the Pacific and not the Atlantic.\nIt is a break to leave Washington and work in a different setting. I have no\nidea if the job will be as good or as importent,but afterall my work is not my\ncareer so I dont really care much.\nI am enclosing some clippings to amuse you. I wonder how much\nnews you get. I immagine Time and Life are your standbys.\nThe weather is about the same. infact everything is the same.\nThe only new face is that of Maurice Fatio. I bycicle home up to Georgetown\nin a lather and stand under a cold shower for fifteen minutes till its\ntime to dress. What a great life this city really is! Hotcha!\n[June 22nd P.M. written in margin] Your island life is so perfect compared to my fetid city existane\nI never was made for desk life in a big city, you once thought you were,but\nI never did. You[']r[e] leading life I like[,]and I am leading the life you though[t]\nyou would like it. Its has humor.\nSince talking to you on the telephone this afternoon I have\nfound out that a one - Mary Kay Potter is planning to go out there as a guest\nof a property owner.I doubt if that works but there may be something in\nactual\"ownership.\" Ellen Dupuy should do the byuing if there is any and then sh\ncan get there to see her property. Having only just heard of this angle I\n[End Page 1]\n2\nsent you you that wire suggesting ti.\n[June 23rd]\nThismorning first thing I went to see Atherton R[i]chards.Do you know his name? [H]e\nowns vast property in Hawaii and gave me a great deal of good sound advice.This isit[!]\nBe sure and see all the surrounding isla[n]d[s]before buying an Awahou. He tells me [hand drawn arrow in margin]\nHonolulu and surroundings will never quite be the same after the war. Too many\npeople will stay on. Business will increase, the airfileds will grow,your neighbors\nare apt to be less pleasant. He strongly advises that if one wishes to settle somewher\nto see all, look everything over. Kawai [or a name like that] he claims is marvelous.\nHe tells me there are ranc_hing islands, islands with mountsin that rise 1400 ft.\nevery sort of climate and fishing, He advises not to buy but build, he said think aft[er]\nthis war what new insulating materials there will be, the modern side of everything\nfrom termite proof composition floors to air conditioning, heliocoptar garage etc. etc.\nThe world will be different, the planes will bring you everywhere in short [o]rder. Dist[-]\nance will be nothing. He was charming to me. We talked a long time. He called up a\nfreind in 02 to find out about transportation out there. He was told every civilian\nmust be passed on by the Commandant of the 12 Naval District in SanRransisco,and that\nonly in the roll of the JOB was their a prayer of getting out. The Army man did not\nthink even owning property would do it for a navy wife. I am going to work awfully\nhard on that angle. For some strange reason when it rains it pours. Just because I\na m ready, able and set to go to the IVY things have broken in other directions too.\nThere is a clew even in this office now that may lead to something. Icant write it\nall out on paper, but there is a straw in the wind brewing, brewing for only the last\n24 hours. If between now and the time my boat sails for Ivy I should get a real\nlead- why ofcourse then I will never get on that boat. I will turn all attention to\nthe Pacific, to the islands, to reaching you. Is N't it funny how things work. Is n'tt\nstrange. When I spoke to you on the phone yesterday I was overcome with emotion. I\njust cant tell you how it felt to hear your voice[,]and to know I was planning to go\neven further away from you, even away from a possible telephone converstaion with\nyou. I wanted s to see you, to hug, to hold on to you. But I wont go into my feelings\nbecause its useless and senseless and just makes us both feel badly all over again.\nI lay in bed all night wide awake thinking, worrying and crying. Its such hell.\nI know Hawaii would be a heaven spot to live in. I am convinced its the\ntype of life we both love. There is ranching, there is business to be done to keep\nfrom a complete Lotis life if need be[,]and it is paradice! the flowers, the sea, the ai\nair , the sun. Atherton Richards tells me he just cant wait to get back there. It has\neverything. He claims he would not live anywhere else in the world. His interests\nout thereare vast and many. I believe the pinapples are his show. He also talked\nabout land, sales etc. He thinks now is the time to sell land in the U.S. because now\nis the time everyone is looking for it. He thinks that after the war there maybe so ma [hand drawn arrow in margin]\nmany new marerials that wood will be substituted for[,]and that perhaps timber will\nnot bring the price we think it will. He was awfully nice. He gave me even the name\nof a construction Co in N.Y.C. to go and see.He thought they might give me a job to \ngo out there for them as they are an enormous concern that operate in Hawaii[,]and do\nall the work for the Navy. Turner is the name. I am going to try every clue between\nnow and a month from now. If the prospects are good at all I shall not go to IVY.\nWhy things should pick up overnight I dont know. It is all so sudden .I am in a tail\nspin. Since starting this letter my information has developed and increased and this\nletter was only started yesterday morning. Its a queer world. On the other hand of cours[e]\nif there turns out to be no way of working a job angle on getting out- then I want to\nhold on to the Ivy trip because The General and David have gone to alot of trouble [hand drawn arrow in margin]\nto send me[,]and I would not want to let them down unless it was to assuredly get to you\nGetting to you cancels everything in my eyes, and [I] immagine I would be forgiven anyho[w]\nas everyone knows how I feel about getting out there.\n[End Page 2]\n3\nJim Forestal has asked me to play tennis this afternoon. I have secured\nspecial permission to levveand hour early in order to try and work\non him. You never know. Thts how things are done. Everything is hap-\npening to me at once. I am all steamed up and nothing will probably\nhappen at all. But believe me I am going ot try.\nThink I will continue this letter from the house after I have seen\nJim.\nJust finished a game of singles with Jim. We palyed at Nelson Rockerfe\neller's house. We got to six all and I was so pooped and out of condition \nI never hit an other thing hardly for the whole ne[x]t set. I was beaten\n8-5 6-2. It was fun, but my I am soft. Cant run a yard. I was so tired\nI thought I would die.\nI did n't get much out of Jim except that he would write a letter for m[e]\nto the Head of the 12th Naval District Sanfransisco when I had a job lined\nup- so I can get transpotation out. That is something anyhow.\nWell as I know no more I shallsay goodnight and go on working on that\nlittle project until the boat sails getting me the otherd[i]rection to\nIvy. You never know. Things always happen at once. Something perfect\nmay break yet before I pull out in the wrong direction.\nLets both pray doodle ears and I may get there. I want to so terribly\nbadly.\nGoodnight and all my love to you always.\nGertie\nJune 24th.\nMy transpotation to Ivy materialises about the First Day of August or\nlast day of July.\nStill no letter f rom you since June 10th.\n[End Page 3]"
