These workers are members of the Hospital Workers and Nursing\nHome Employees, a union in Charleston.\nThese workers have petitions supporting them signed by over/2500\nregistered voters - businessmen, professional people, and interested\ncitizens.\n\"We want to speak about our hardships to the representatives we\nhave elected,\" and said Isaiah Bennett, organizer of hospital workers in\nSouth Carolina. \"We are having trouble in getting Dr. McCord to meet\nwith us. We want the legislature to help. We have been organized for\nover a year. This is our last trip anywhere. If this attempt to arrange\na meeting with the hospital administration fails, we will come back\nto Charleston and do whatever we have to do to achieve our goal."
