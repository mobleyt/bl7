Of the youthful warriors, who at the outset of the contest crowded to the standard of their country; the deceased, was among the earliest, the youngest, and the most ardent. Though \"fallen in the first of his fields,\" he earned the honor accorded by their country, to all who perish in her cause, and which seems especially due to those who cast the flower of their youth upon her Altar, who prefer her glory, to life- and shield her soil with their bodies, when they can no longer defend it with their swords."
