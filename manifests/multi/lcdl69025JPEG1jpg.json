      "value": "PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII\nBOX 166, NAVY YARD\nDecember 21, 1942\nDear Gertie,\nMerry Christmas or at least as merry a on as is possible with all\nof us separated as we are. I was reading Life last night and came across\nthat big full-page advertisement of Four Roses that has the eggnog receipe\nthat was always used on Christmas morning. I remember the fun we always had\nbeating up the eggs and arguing whether we shouldn't double the amount of\nwhiskey called for. After all this darn war can't last forever, and one of \nthese days we will all be back together again.\nThank you ever so much for your letter of November 17, congratulating\nme being a \"proud father\". I acknowledge that I am a father but I don't \nknow about the proudness part of it. I always seem to reckon the whole\nthing had been done occasionally by other people in the past, and that it\nis really nothing very new. Sidney and I think having a baby must have\ndriven Nancy nuts for she is sending [me] all kinds of strange things. One\nday I received a hank of red hair which she must have pulled from the poor\nkids head; shortly afterwards she sent me a photograph of the baby's foot-\nprints. Can you imagine me framing them and keeping them on my desk? If \nthe war hasn't done anything else, it will at least save me from having\nto get up in the middle of the night to rock the crib.\nSidney misses you terribly but otherwise is fit as a fiddle and is\nvery interested in what he's doing. He plays tennis often at lunch time\nwith a boy by the name of Teddy Burwell. He used to be rated about 14th\nin the United States, and when he was in Oxford, spent all of his time \ntraveling over Europe playing in tournaments. He is really darn good, and\nhe and Sidney have some marvelous games. This old man has had to give up\ntennis since my series of bad colds. They seem to have run me down quite a \nbit with the result that my heart pounds with the slightest bit of exercise.\nOur job isn't very exciting but at least there is always so much going\non that you never have time to think whether it is dull or not. Sidney and\nI are supposed to be the executive officers of the Intelligence 6enter,\nPacific Ocean Areas. What executive officer means we have still to find out.\nI am beginning to think it means trying to get things that other people are\ntoo lazy to get for themselves. The Center is broken up into a variety of\nsections such as Air Intelligence Section, Radio Section, Photographic Section,\nWeather Section, Objective Data Section, etc. Some of the sections have\nseveral hundres men, others are smaller. This, of course, is supposed to be\nsecret, but I am writing to the most secret of secret persons of Strategic\nService so I suppose there couldn't be any objection in telling you. When we\nstarted, we found no office at all, then we had a little office in a basei-\nment, after a month moving to great big new offices especially arranged for us.\n[End Page 1]\nBy now we have grown out of that and are just starting on a new two story\nbuilding for our exclusive use. This building is going to be right next to\nthe CINCPAC building. In case you don't know, CINCPAC stands for Commander\nin Chief, Pacific Fleet. In view of the fact that he has specifically asked\nfor us to be moved up right next to him must mean that they think the\nIntelligence Center is doing a good job. This is especially gratifying in\nview of the fact that when we all first came out here, no one wanted\n\"hide nor hair\" of us. And the common question seemed to be, \"Why the hell\nanother Intelligence organization?\"\nWe have been in our new apartment about a month and one half now. We\nhave more privacy and perhaps more space than we had at the Halekulani Hotel,\nbut I really don't like it quite as much because it is so far from the water,\nand the hotel had lovely trees, flowers, and grass which we don't have now.\nI hope that some day we will be able to find a little house right on the\nwater. We really haven't seen anybody since we have been out here for we\nare just too darn tired to talk after the work at the office is finished.\nI think I have dined out exactly twice in the 3[half] months. One of the times\nwith Lester Armour and once with Jack Merrill's [mother.] We usually leave the\noffice about half past 5, get home about 6. Sidney then goes for a short\nswim while I experiment with the pots and pans. We both are in bed by 7\nread and suffer with indigestion till about 10; then sleep until 6. It is\ncertainly not a very exciting life.\nMerry Christmas again!\nLots of Love,\nMorris\n[End Page 2]"
