      "value": "Savannah March 25 1840 Rev & Dear Brother, My. Fielding applied to Bp. Ives on Saturday last, and having procured the required testimonials, was yesterday received as a candidate for six months. As he has been very highly esteemed here by the congregation to whom he ministered, his renunciation of the Romish faith will produce a great sensation when it comes to be generally known. It is his intention to proceed to Charleston next week, and he will be happy to avail himself, no doubt, of the aid of your Education fund during the period of his probation. My interest in his case increases with every interview, and I sincerely hope and pray that he may be so guided & directed, by the spirit of God, as to prove a valuable accession to our church. The visitation of Bishop Ives has made a deep impression here upon us all. The services on Sunday were highly interesting--and a more delightful and elevating day I have never Experienced. You have doubtless ere this, however, heard all about it from those who were eye-witnesses, and whose presence & participation, heightened the impressiveness of the services. What remains [End Page 1] but that a people, so highly favoured of the Lord in outward privileges as having all things become new, should seek in the renewing of their minds a corresponding inward substitution of all that is comely, for the deformity of Evil & corrupt affections: and, making a right use of the temple made with hands, be rendered, thro' the ordinances therein dispensed, meet to be partakers of that hand which is Eternal in the heavens. With very great regard I remain Rev & Dear Sir Your friend & bro Ed Neufville Bishop Ives, in order to get to Charleston in time for the Wilmington boat on Friday was obliged to set off for Augusta this morning with the Expectation of getting there tonight, & resting tomorrow. The weather has been very inclement, and I feel anxious lest his health should suffer from the journey. Bishop Chase is still here, and will probably remain over Sunday. [End Page 2] Rev. E. Neufville March 25th 1840 respecting the (illegible) of Mr. Fielding <SAVANNAH MARCH 26 GEO> Revd W.H. Barnwell Charleston S.C. [In Margin] Savannah, Ga [End Page 3]"
