      "value": "Cheraw Sept 8th Rev & dear Father, I hope you will not be offended with me for writing to you, it has been so long since I have received a line from you that I thought I would try once more. You have not written to me since March & when you left here in June you promised to write but to my great sorrow you have not done so, if you do not answer this, I will know then that you have not time to read my letters & therefore, much less time to answer them. I try to be resigned I suppose as we are in time of war we must not only be deprived of seeing those we love most dearly but also be deprived of hearing from them. It grieved us very much to learn that you were unwell & we sincerely trust that you are quite restored. We heard that you spoke of coming up very soon but we do not let ourselves have the hope for fear of being disappointed. Nothing would afford us more happiness at this time than a visit from you. Your family are all well your brother Francis has gone to Richmond since Thursday last. Mrs Posi is still at Society Hill, she speaks of coming home soon. Dear Father, Hennie wrote to you some time ago to ask if you ever received the letter[End Page 1] with the checks you sent us we sent it in such a hurry we do not know if you ever received it. Hugh went to Charleston on Friday last & returned on Saturday, he could not find you he tried very much to see you but every place he went they told him you had just left. I must sign myself \"daughter\" this time as you told me you did not know Ma's letters from mine. Ma & Hennie join in much love to you. do write if it is only a line. Pray for Your grateful & obedient \"Daughter\" The baby is sick today he has fever we sent for the Doctor, he has had it for two or three days[End Page 2]"
