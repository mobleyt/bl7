      "value": "Charleston June 12 1866 Maj. T. B. Ferguson Dear Sir. Your letter of the 11th from the Barrows was recd. by mail last evening and soon after Mr [Cannon?] called at my house with your second letter on the same subject. This morning Mr Gillespie went with Mr C. to the Mayors office to know if any thing could be suggested there to track, or cross the path of the mule and thief, but it ended in nothing more than leaving a description of the mule at the Police office and Mr [Cannon?] returns in a few hours. He will take with him the files. viz 1 Doz Mill Saw files Second Cut. Mr. Gravely says this is the kind you want-Mr Gillespie lost your letter containing the order when he went to the R.R to forward the Sweeps, but says your order was five fine cut, there is one cut finer than these and if Mr Gravely thinks it better to send that kind I will send you a doz by the boat this evening. The three Sisters will take up the Saw, the coal, the lime, and 10 Bbls flour which I believe is all the articles you ordered. She is to have on board 4 Carpenters, 1 Bricklayer, and a plough man, the latter is one of Christians hands and says he is a thorough plough man wages to be arranged with you says he is equal to any work at the mill also and expects [End Page 1] the same wages as the other hands. I enclose the agreement with the Carpenters one has not yet signed it-you will see I have advanced each $5 on rect. of wages.-Respecting the Steam Pump. I will write you again-think I will get it, but have not fully made up my mind to spend so much more money- I think the Mule will never be obtained- am glad no more have gone with it- Have been looking for something of the kind for some time the only chance will be to advertize. And keep a good look out- that no more go after it. Yours in haste W. McBurney [End Page 2]"
