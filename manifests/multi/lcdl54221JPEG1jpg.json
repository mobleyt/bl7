      "value": "Cat Island Feby [February] 8th 1862 My Dear Wife As Mr Long will probably leave here in the morning for home I will write you a long letter on a long piece of Paper and send it to you by Long. I am out of all other kind of Paper and am therefore compelled to use this kind to write on and I hate it too for it is scarce Paper in these Confederate States. I am also out of this bad weather too. My House is completed and I am now under a good shingle Roof with a Roaring Fire in a Brick chimney with a Table before me a candle on the table a good chew of good Tobacco in my mouth and the rain pattering down on the Roof. Oh how it makes me think of Home and old times when we lived at Hickory Hill and I used to write of nights while you sat in the corner sewing I thinking of Isa and my writing and you thinking of Isa and your sewing while the Cat happy soul had nothing to think of but occasionally to half think and half dream that she was just in the Act of having a nice old time with some unfortunate mouse. Neither you nor I nor the Cat once dreaming that a few short years would illustrate the words of Burns that The best laid schemes of mice and men oft go astray, but even so it is this night of storm and tempest is a fit emblem of the Storm of anger that has been engendered in the hearts of the American people by a long series of offences on the one side and endurance on the other and the tempest is but a weak type of the tempest of War raised by this strife, it is seen and felt every day and even now while I write I can hear high above the sullen roar of the maddened ocean, the dull heavy booming of minute Guns away far off on the Coast, telling that some armed Vessel is in distress, either having been shattered on the wide waters or what is more probable driven into shallow water by this North East wind, it is densely foggy tonight and I have no doubt that some of Lincoln fleet have gone ashore or otherwise got into trouble. Well the Lord in his Kindness send them speedily and safely into Belzebubs bosom, where they may find water scase [scarce?] and material for killing Bees plentiful. I would have made an effort to get the chance to go up the River tomorrow with Daggett on the Steam Boat, but she comes right back again on Monday so that if I went I could not go home and\n[End Page 1]\nget back to the mill in time to take passage back here in her, and I don't care to be that near Home and not go all the way. I will however either come home to Equity Court (which is the 18th) or failing in that come home on Saturday next, there is so much sickness in the Regiment that the Colonel dislikes to furlough any one Home that is well. indeed he has refused a great many pressing applications from officers and some of them too in Cases where their families at Home were sick and really needed their presence, he does this I know not because he wants to be harsh or cruel but from a stern sence [sense] of duty, if we were attact [attacked] here at this time it would be as much as we could do to retreat and save our sick even to do this we would in all probability have to abandon our baggage ammunition and Stores, and then I think it would be hard work to save the sick. South Island on which the Hospitals are situated is surrounded on two sides by water and on the other sides by a marsh two miles in width, across this Marsh there is only one Road and since the Rainy weather has set in, this Road is almost impassable, so if the Steam Boat should happen to be absent our dependence would be in Waggons which is slow business, our Company have no men there. We keep our sick here and nurse them in their own houses, they are all mending except Allen, he is very lowe [low]. Why do you write me such short Letters? I am sorry that the spirits of the old Adam and old Amelia and the old Devil have again broke out in Nancy's case. I don't know what to do if you can't get some of my friends to chastise them out of her. will you just say to her for me that as sure as there is a God above us if she puts me to the necessity of comeing [coming] home to settle accounts with her I will make the settlement final. I will sell her away from her children where she will never see or hear of them again. I mean exactly what I write, this is no time for her to commence any of her fool with me if I go home on her account Melly she travels sure. do write to me by the first chance and let me know how you get on for something to eat, and how your health is and every thing about you that can interest me, and that will be anything you write. Kiss my Darling children for me and tell them that the hardest thing I have to beare [bear] in my exile from you and them is the thought that you forget me. I have fulfilled the promise with which I commenced and have written you a long letter and as it is now midnight I will close Good Night John R. Beaty\n[End Page 2]"
