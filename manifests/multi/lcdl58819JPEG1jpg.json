      "value": "GEORGE W. SIMONS, .JR.  May 13, 1944  Mr. Robert N.S.Whitelaw .Director  Carolina irt issocialtion,  Gibbes Art Gallery,  Charleston 5 South Carolina.  Dear Mr.  Whitelaw;  I have been thinking a ot about that traffic flow survey to  be made on the 24th. although I fee confident that you can  handle the various detais incident to it, yet I do not want to  et you down. My time for the remainder of the month is jammed to the hit but notwithstanding I will be with you for the  most important part of the work,that of meeting the boys and  gliving them final instructions Tuesday night,the 23rd. After  we deiver to each boy their taey sheets with station assign  ments and give them their final instructions,there is itte  more we can do.  So I will come up on the morning train of the 23rd,getting me  into Charleston during the afternoon about one ocock. That will  get me there in plenty of time to check final detais with you  before the meeting at night and also in time to meet with any  part of your main committee in the afternoon if you so desire.  I would ike very much however to leave Charleston on the 11:10  Tuesday night so I can be back here the 24th. Incidentay could  you call the Coast Line office and reserve a ower for me on the  11:10 that night.  I hope you are able to ocate several good boys to act as ieutenants for us. That would simpify matters a ot and greaty ease  the job of coecting the taey sheets after the counto It would  also take much of the worry from your shoulders.  Best regards,I am  Sincerely yours  P.S. My Secretary is off this week so I am acting as my own typist,  Thanks for the cheek which was received yesterday,, I will bring an  expense statement with me on the next trip.  G.W.S."
