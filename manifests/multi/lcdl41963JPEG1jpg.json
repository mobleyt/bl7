      "value": "Col S.C. Sept 24 1866 Dear Brother I wrote you a troublesome letter while in N.Y. from which I have heard nothing, consequently I take it you had not time to look after it, or looking after, it was not satisfactory, or perhaps you did not receive it, Meeting Revd Mr Flynn today I hear you will be in Charleston before next Sunday otherwise I might have been at a loss to know where to Send the Enclosed R.R. ticket, for which you have to thank Sister Ellen. When She was starting to Alabama I went to the Cars with her, and meeting Mr Johnston, introduced him not only to Revd Father Pellicer but to Sister also, She wrote me he had been very Kind on the way to Augusta, and had promised you a free ticket, which she wished me to see delivered, today I recd the Enclosed together with one for the Mother Superior, to July/67, and one to Revd [J.?] P. O connell to April/67, which I will not be able[End Page 1] to deliver, as the Old Dr has not been here but one Sunday since you left, and as Father Laurance of Joseph do not either fill the name, I will have to ask you what to do with it, both of those gentlemen are here, and if you say so, I can hand it to Either of them. I am glad to be able to give a good account from the Convent. Dr M-- is indefatigable, Slim as he looks, but it seems there are some others as watchful as himself, for instance, feeling more secure one night, than usual, he Slept Soundly, Knowing the Moon was shining bright and Mr [Scanlan?] on the Watch, he did not get up before day as usual and look over his fields, behold the next morning the first thing presented to his view on entering the field was a Shuck, of superior appearance or feeling which, he became convinced he[End Page 2] had been robbed, on examination he found some person or persons had brought a waggon to the Side of the field and had taken about Eight bushels of Corn, he determined to pull it the first day afterwards, that the weather would permit, and in the mean time every person interested on the premises had to Keep a good look out, so had those who had no business, of they put themselves in the way, guns & pistols, were put in order, and Every man at his post. Miss Graham is anxious to Know if She can accompany you and Anna to Baltimore, I wrote to Anna that She said She would meet her any where she might appoint, but of course Anna is guided Entirely by you, consequently it will depend on you whether she will go on with her or not, if you think yes-- let me Know which way you will go, and where She Shall meet you, and when, whether at Florence or Columbia,[End Page 3] if no, perhaps as well say nothing about it, but if not too inconvenient I think she would be an excellent travelling companion for Anna, but you Know your own business better than I do, therefore I can only suggest not advise, Practice free, time hard, money very scarce, and getting scarcer, family all quite well, and join in affectionate love Pray for Your affectionate brother John Lynch Rt Revd Bishop Lynch Charleston S.C.[End Page 4]"
