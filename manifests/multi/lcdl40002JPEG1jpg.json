      "value": "BATAVIA 13 Feb. 1839 No. 2 --sidence [residence]. The only objection is the rent is high, but in this we cannot better ourselves by a change. We sometimes bring you nearer to us by fancying you the occupant of a chamber adjoining our own & picture to ourselves the pleasure you would take in seeing us in our daily routine & sharing with us for a short season our curry, pine apples, bananas &c together with our pleasures & our cares. I am sure it would relieve your mind of most of the painful & distressing inconveniences with which you fancy us surrounded. Our circle of friends has been very much diminished by the departure of our Bros? of the American Board for Borneo. In their place we have recd. Mr. Medhurst from England, with whose name you are acquainted. He is a good Chinese scholar & I hope to derive & indeed am deriving great assistance from him in the acquisition of that language. After fighting out (may I not say?) a given portion with my Chinese Teacher, I read it over with him & receive an explanation of unresolved difficulties. My progress in the language has been very encouraging. I was last year a little imprudent in studying too much, being hurried on too fast by an anxiety to commence at once the practical business of my station, the proclamation of God's mercy & grace to the poor Heathen around me in their own tongue. The consequence has been an affection of my head which has rendered it necessary for me to reduce my time devoted to the Chinese (temporarily I hope) to four or five hours each day. Should the Lord grant me health & grace to continue to devote this attention to it I have no doubt I shall soon commence using it to advantage. I am now reading the works of their great Sage Confucius. You request in your letter that I would be very particular in my accounts of the mission & its probable success. The state of the mission is almost told when I have narrated to you the circumstances of its members & their progress in the language, for in this incipient stage the study of the language is our great business & we are unable for want of it, to put in motion any extensive agencies for the good those around us. Our remaining Bro: Mr. Lockwood we fear will soon be constrained to follow Mr. Hanson & return home. His health is very delicate unfitting him for the great labor requisite to acquire the Chinese language. He is very unwilling to come to the conclusion that after having spent three years here, he must return home & all of it be thrown away; but I fear he will not be able to stay here with any prospect of promoting the object for which he was sent. He is endeavoring to stay this year thro, as a probationary one to decide on his future course. The prospect of his return afflicts [End Page 1] us very much for he is an excellent man & we are sincerely attached to him: the Lord however may do better for us than our fears & he may be enabled to remain. Our labors just now with the exception of the distribution of tracts to such of the Chinese as can read are confined to the young in schools. Sally had during eight months of the last year a class of eight or nine Chinese girls who came three times a week & were taught to read Malay in the Roman character. They can now read tolerably well in the testament. This year we will endeavor to extend the class to 20 or 25; to superintendance. I say this year, for our commencement of new operations for '39 does not take place for two or three weeks yet in compliance with the Chinese year. We desire with the commencement of the Chinese New Year to open a school on our premises for boys to teach English & Chinese. The advantage of adding English to the list of their studies is great as our object is to train up teachers & preachers of the Gospel & there are as yet no suitable books in their language from which to give them an education that shall qualify them for this purpose. To effect our object in this respect we must obtain the children from their parents for five or six years, lodge, feed, clothe, & take the whole charge of them while under instruction. This I contemplated as one means of usefulness before I left home & it has risen very much in importance in my view since I came here. We have been encouraged, whilst hesitating whether we should postpone it for another year, to make an effort to commence at once by the receipt of a donation of $250 from Mrs. Gibbes & a few other excellent ladies in Charleston, to be spent in the education of Chinese youth. I shall write immediately to Mrs. Gibbes to thank her, but should you see her, please convey to herself & friends the assurance of our warmest gratitude for the assistance thus afforded us & for promoting our means of usefulness. Besides these already mentioned we have a school of 40 conducted by a Chinese man under our supervision in which the boys are taught the Gospels in Chinese & Malay & assemble every Sunday at our house as a Sabbath school. Of the prospect of success from these efforts we can at present give only very general answers. With the progress of the children in their education & in a knowledge of the Gospel History we were very much gratified at their annual examination a few days since, what influence the truths they have been taught has produced upon their minds & hearts the divine eye alone can discover; but we believe it to be good & that to an amount that should encourage us to more active & enlarged exertions for the ensuing year. The husbandman must sow in faith; such is the reward which the Lord of the harvest grants at a later season & we are firmly persuaded & well assured that humble, faithful & unremitting labor will meet as [MS torn] reward here, as in any part of the great vineyard.
