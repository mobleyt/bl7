      "value": "Rose Hill 27th Feb 1835. I must begin right off by asking, dear James. What has become of you. Your GrFather assails me every time I go there with complaints against you particularly for your never acknowledging the receipt of the money forwarded you by Mr. Ladson. now I really wish in future you would be more punctual as you know I don't like to hear you reproached. particularly when I can't take your part as in this case. as I have always deemed that an essential duty. the last we have heard of you was through your Aunt Smith's letter. I am afraid you have too many kind correspondent's who supply you so well with home news that you do not feel obliged to write by the way of inducing an answer. Nat amused me very much by telling me what kind of letters he thought would interest you. judging from John Barnwell's [?] that his Sisters had not written him that an Old Negro has died under the School House in Beaufort. which Mr Stuart related to him when at the North. I told Nat I would leave him to tell you all such News. Mr Stuart has sent in his resignation to the College. on the thought I hear of having married a Lady of fortune. I think he is a great loss to the College he certainly is a Superior teacher. Our thoughts have been much engrossed for the last fortnight in lamenting the congregation of St Philips Church which perhaps you have heard of before this. it was burnt down to the ground on Sunday morning the 15th of this month and but one monument saved and that representing the [figure?] of Grief. it is really a loss to the City for its great antiquity and peculiar architecture [End Page 1] The Congregation I am told are in dismay for you know they perfectly idolized the old Edifice. And now they are obliged to accept of the Methodist meeting House in Cumberland St. to Preach in for a time. They have already began to collect money to rebuild it. And no doubt it will be speedily executed as so healthy a part of the Community are interested in it. I am told that the morning it happened Dr Gadsden Preached to a few Gentlemen that collected in the Sunday School room. And that he was so much affected that he could hardly command himself. it was the same day that Wm Elliott C. Pinckney Mr Fowles and Beaufort Stephen were ordained they all preached in the afternoon at the different Churches. Elizabeth wrote me that she heard Stephen in St Peters and was agreeably surprised. in his preaching he is engaged in McPhersonville. but the others I have heard nothing of. We are getting on with St Peters. The walls are not built up above the Windows. Wm has moved in a House ready opposite to it which is a much better one than he lived in. Edward is to be married the middle of April. it is to be a very Private Wedding only the nearest relations to be asked. Your GrFather is to go down to give her away. I have heard of two engagements since I wrote you last Albert Smith to a Miss Taylor of Columbia a Lady three years older than himself, and Francis Parker to Mr Lance's Step Daughter. I believe her name is Alston. And one more I forgot, Miss Constance Devt. to Wm Gaillard. the Lt. Genl. of the State Guard. now you see I do my best to scrape up all the News for you but remember I don't vouch for the truth of it- it is of course all hearsay. Nat was over here a fortnight ago and stayed with us. he looked very badly. but he had just recovered from the Influenza which has been very prevalent [End Page 2] all Winter. he was fortunate this time in seeing a Deer killed by Mr. Heyward which is the only one he has killed this Winter but he has been out less than I have ever known him. indeed the Weather has been so severe that home has always been the best place and even today we had a Shower of Snow which lasted about an hour. and about the 8th of the month we had the Severest weather ever remembered in Carolina. the thermometer in the back Piazza stood at 3 deg at seven oclock in the morning and in the house at 16 deg. now I suppose that is quite common with you. but then you don't feel it as severely because it is more steadily cold. it only lasted here three days. the Ice in the Pond was 2 inches thick and by way of experiment we packed up four barrels to make Ice Cream. and which we have been regaling ourselves with. but the Weather is not quite warm enough to enjoy it. and yet it is melting so fast that I am obliged to be in a [hurry?] with it...I [page torn] in hopes of hearing from Beaufort to-day and [giving?] you the latest information but did not therefore can only say that every one was well ten days ago. Cousin Betsey has a Daughter about a month old. Cousin Robert and Stephen are gone to the Episcopal Convention which met last Wednesday. There has been the largest collection of Wild Beasts in Charleston this Winter that has ever been there before. and your Aunt Elizabeth has been taking a ride on the Elephant which is a monstrous Creature but admirably taught. I can tell you nothing of the Races. but I observed that your namesake James Heyward [?] a horse. and Savage Heyward is as great a Bean as ever. and is a Manager of the Laney Ball. All of the youngest men appear to be made acting Managers I expect to see Wm Heyward among them soon. he partly promised us a visit in April but he never seems certain of any thing. I saw advertised [End Page 3] Mr. Adam's Sermon on the Eclipse. I think I must buy it and read it to you to keep you in mind of your old Friend. I suppose it must be very grand from its being published. I heard Wm on that Sunday in Beaufort and he spoke beautifully upon it I never formed any idea of so [?] an Eclipse. it was a most sight. and the Stars that were visible were as bright as they are at night. I hope My dear James that you are still happy and contented in College. but the truth is you write too seldom. I must insist upon your writing to me oftener. and telling me all that you are doing. I wish in your Studies that you would give particular attention to the French Language. I think it such an advantage to a Private Gentleman, and then should you travel in Europe it would be every thing to you. and you know what I have set my heart on is after you Graduate with great Honour you should come home for six months and then take a Tour for only eighteen months. but Oh! how vain are all of my calculations I must now bid you good-bye dear James. with saying that we are all quite well. the children all coveting how old they will be when Cousin James comes home giving you always four years. Yours Affec. - Elzh- [center:] Blue House March 1st 35 James. B. Heyward. Cambridge Massachusetts. [End Page 4]"
