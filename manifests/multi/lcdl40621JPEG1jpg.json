      "value": "Charleston July 13th 1847 Dear Mamma I come today with more cheerfulness to write to you than when last I wrote--the cloud soon passed away, and my mind has been calm & peaceful ever since. When trials come before me, I feel them deeply, but by the grace of God they seem all to work for my good. My best welfare--and it is astonishing how much the aspect of things is changed afterwards; when often having been exercised by the chastening, the peaceable fruits of righteousness are experienced in the heart--I believe that this is one of the modes, our Heavenly Father employs to sanctify his people and purify their hearts. We have had delightful weather, cool but rainy--And we pass our time very pleasantly; At Home, I may say, for several weeks I have not been out, except to church--What with the cool, delightful weather, the frequent use of baths, the comforts of our delightful house, and the happy enjoyments of them all, alike, by the children, I fell that I cannot be sufficiently thankful for the many undeserved blessings I enjoy. I constantly feel \"Not more than others I deserve, Yet God has given me more\"--Indeed sometimes when I consider the many & various blessings that are vouchsafed me, both of temporal & spiritual nature, I feel ready to accuse myself of deep ingratitude to the Kind Giver of All, and to think myself, it may be a \"[Haamare?]\". But it is not Discontent--my endeavour is to be under all the circumstances of life content--believing as I do that all things are ordered by [crosswritten, continued from end of letter:] \"remarkable child\"--I got a long letter from Elisa Johnston last week--They were all quite well and enjoying [fires?]--Mr. Maxwell cannot realise that it is summer--I have not seen Sarah James, or James for a long time & do not know how they are--with much love to Papa I am your affectionate daughter Mary [Mayan?] begs to give her love to John & to say that she wishes to hear from him by letter to know how he is. She has been expecting a letter from him. [End Page 1] Him, who knows what is best suited for us. I have not seen Stanna in a long while--this I regret, but she is still disabled--I sent some of the children there yesterday afternoon on a message of inquiry--she was in her chamber & gave but a poor account of her foot, that the Dr. had again cut it--it is really a serious matter. I shall try to go there this afternoon, after service--this is Tuesday. No doubt she has written to you, and you are perhaps better informed of her affairs than I am. Virginia I see but seldom, but hear from her frequently--in the way of little interchanges from the table. She sends me frequently some of her rich soups & dainty dishes, and I send some of [Mayan's?] biscuits & Breads. I see her pass late every afternoon, near 7 o'clock with the children to take a ride--I have adopted a very pleasant place for taking tea for the warm season & one which the children like very much--As I said before my afternoons are spent at home, at 5 or 6 o'clock I take my seat in my rocking chair at the South West corner of the dining room opposite two windows, looking out into the garden where the children are at play--I of course am not Idle, but have my work basket & Book--with the folding and other doors open, you can't think how delightful it is. At 1/2 past six or seven o'clock the Boys take their Bath, which is a [frolic?] to them, dress clean & come in the piassa [piazza]--sit & talk with me until Tea which is at 1/2 past seven exactly--To a table in the dining room they come in, with cooling refreshments--Ice water, & lemonade sometimes, in place of tea, Bread Biscuits, toast, iced butter & generally some sweetmeat or fruit--They enjoy this repast very much & seem to look forward with pleasure, to taking tea, as they call it.[End Page 2] So that the whole affair is nearly over before lights are brought. the lamps generally come in at the conclusion. Then I take my work & sew until bedtime. 1/2 past nine. And here you have our daily afternoon routine--very pleasant I, together with the children find it--I think it very desirable to use all the means we can to make Home a happy place to our children; & there is no telling what a beneficial influence may be had on Boys especially, in making even the social tea drinking, possessed of a charm to them. The nice Raspberry Jam furnished an addition to our Sunday evenings repast, for Mr. M's especial benefit--& which he admired very much--this is the only evening that we have the pleasure of his company--He takes coffee at dinner and cares not for any thing after. A little tea is made for me and any one else whom it may suit better than the cold drinks--Ellen has been indisposed for some days in her usual way. Headache, [giddiness?] loss of appetite and looks badly. We kept her from school a few days last week & are giving her Saratoga water to drink, early in the morning--She was better & went to school yesterday, but came home, much fatigued & with headache--we have concluded to lighten her labours of school, leave off some of her studies until her health becomes stronger. She has such energy & activity of mind that I see plainly; it is physical inability alone that interrupts her. For some time past she has been quite well, and really her lessons, numerous as they are gave her no concern: she learnt them all at school, & had the afternoons to play & work in her little garden--but since her indisposition last week; she seems oppressed by her lessons--indeed with her state of exhaustion & depression, it seems wrong to require so much mental exertion--I have Lucy too staying at home still--& have concluded to keep her at home, as my scholar, until Fall--I instruct[End Page 3] her about an hour or more in the morning and I think it best for her health to remain at home--Poor Sam, he never came home until 4 o'clock yesterday--not kept in--these long sessions must be injurious--but he does not suffer from it as yet. Jane Read came to see me last week with two of her children--she had heard from Harleston from Halifax. She said that the cool weather had so revived her mother as to induce her to reliquish the thought of going North--Uncle Read came to see us last week--He was so much pleased with our little Willie, whom I sent over to see him, (He, Uncle R. having several times asked me to send him) that he has sent on to New York for a Hobby Horse for him--not being able to get a good one here--He treated Willie very kindly--played the organ for him, gave him cake & ice water--& Willie must have received all his attentions in a becoming way for Uncle Read says still that he considers him a Mrs. Dr. W Wilkinson Care of Dr. W Wilkinson Orangeburg So Ca [End Page 4]"
