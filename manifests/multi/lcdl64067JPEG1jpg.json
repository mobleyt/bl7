      "value": "Beaufort Oct. 5th 1840 I had just determined to act \"the generous\" my dear James I got your direction from cousin Mary when your most welcome letter arrived. You surprise me by seeming to expect [fearing it is impossible!] a criticism- if you knew what miserable specimens of the act I considered my own- you would think that I hardly dared to criticize any letter. Suppose I were capable it is no proof of sense or nonsense- for some of the most sensible write worst in every way and the weakest women often pen the most agreeable letters. The feeling which dictates the letter is that which pleases or not however much we may endeavour to conceal it- it will come out- as we feel so will we write. I feel oftenest stupid so alas! are my efforts. You certainly are the most inveterate \"anti lady\" young gentleman I ever met with and I feel more disposed than ever to shake you well- for the disappointment you caused me. Cousin Mary answered my inquiries of you \"that you were enjoying yourself extremely in society\" and had made many \"acquaintances\" so I concluded that certainly some ladies were amongst them- I begin to suspect that you have no heart have you lost it my dear- shall I look for it? You may have left it- if so and you desire it I will bring it on with me to meet [End Page 1] you in Charleston. There are no \"golden vases\" here or I should do my very best to get you one in which to keep it. A man without a heart remember is the dullest of all dull creatures. so let me beg you to look after your own. I had long since given up my vain youthful dream of \"influence\" or I should mind excessively the utter disregard you showed for my last injunction- \"James you must go into company.\" I suppose you forgot it. Your excuse would be good if I had not known you to be a \"very Benedict\" I scarcely suppose you expect news of any thing but the fever. I am happy to say it is subsiding- Mr Heyward and myself are in a state of desperation at present. I am obliged to stay in Beaufort for my health and he at Bay Point for his. A most agreeable disposition of things! May you come to no worse! My Venus- was made to accommodate herself to her \"ticklish\" position. I should like to take a peep at that same gallery of sculpture- but I hardly think I could agree with you in its superiority over painting. The last speaks the soul- the mind- the best part of man- the [?] spark. the former- the earthly [?] partition- everchanging- decaying- the animal. Mr Heyward sends his love and says he hopes to meet you in Charleston before you leave for the country- I will be with him. Little Nat is as bright and beautiful as ever \"the fact is\" [to use Wm Wigg's expression] he is in disputably the very most uncommon child in the whole world.\" not excepting the twins for of course they two only have the portion of one. Now dear James I have treated you as a sister- the only light in which you should view me- [End Page 2] the only one in which I desire to be [?] by yourself and Hetty- for those in our positions we must love or dislike each other. The heart can feel no indifference to such near connections. I desire to be loved not thought more of than I deserve- I hope for leniency towards my many faults. Hoping that I will meet no disappointment in this I send you a kiss from \"little Nat\" I keep his father's all for myself- but would with most pleasure send you one from \"a young lady.\" If you knew the many interceptions you would overlook all \"mishaps\" in this letter from Yr affectionate sister Eliza [End Page 3] BEAUFORT S.C. OCT 7 Mr James. B Heyward Philadelphia Pennsylvania [End Page 4]"
