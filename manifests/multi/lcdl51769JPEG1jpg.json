      "value": "GOODSELLS's\nPATENT HEMP AND FLAX DRESSER, [and] GRAIN THRASHER.\n\nREFERENCES.\nA A A The Frame.\nB The Cylinder.\nC C C [and]c. 8 Beaters of Wood, two inches by one and three quarters, made of maple or other hard wood, and rounded on the inside.\nD D D D [and]c. 8 Scutchers or Slats of Wood, two and three quarter inches wide, and three quarters thick, 2 feet long, the outer points cut conically.\nF Small Whirl, 8 inches diameter, fixed to the axis of the Cylinder.\nG Vertical Drum, 6 feet diameter, on the axis of which is a Whirl, 18 inches diameter.\nHH Leather Strap or Band 5 inches wide, which runs over the Drum G and the small Whirl F.\nI Horizontal Drum, 12 feet diameter, around which, and the large Whirl on the axis of G passes a band or strap, which turns the Drum G, and puts the whole Machine in motion.\nK Husk or Rest, over which the Hemp, Flax or Grain, is held, when broken and beaten by the Cylinder. This I have sent unbound the 13 rig [illegible]\nL Scutching Board over which the Flax is held after being broken by the Cylinder, and when it is to be whipped out clean of the shieves by the Scutchers D D [MS Torn] [and]c. not used for [MS torn] Gra\nM Upright Plank, about 3 feet high, with a notch in the upper end, sufficiently large to allow the outer end of the Scutching Board L to play 3 inches.\n\nThe above proportions are calculated for a horse who walks 3 times round his path of 24 feet diameter in a minute. One horse is quite sufficient to drive it. When water power is made use of, the large wheel and its accompanying figures are dispensed with. The cylinder performs best when driven at the rate of 200 revolutions in a minute [and] upwards.\n\nThe above described machine is cylindrical in its form, and made entirely of iron, excepting the beaters and scutchers. Weighs about 200 lbs.; is 5 feet long and two and a half feet diameter; may be made in 3 days, and is calculated to break and dress both hemp and flax, in a style superior to that dressed by hand, and also to thrash from.\n\n[End Page 1]\n30 to 40 bushels of any kind of grain a day. It is not calculated, however, to dress either hemp or flax in an unrotted state. They are both to be well rotted, when 100 lbs. of flax and from 100 to 200 lbs. of hemp can be dressed by one man in a day.\n\nFor breaking flax the frame or husk K, (which describes a segment of a circle under the cylinder) is placed within about half of an inch of the cylinder itself. Here the sheaves are forced endwise under the cylinder or breakers, the small end first, and when sufficiently broken, the other end is put under; and when the whole is broken, the operator turns to the scutchers, where the dirt and shives are entirely beaten out. For this operation, about one pound of the plant at a time, is found to be the most convenient and manageable quantity. \n\n[MS. Torn]ng grain, the frame or husk K, is to be moved back from the body of the cylinder [MS. Torn] inches; a broad board to be fixed on the resting board, at an inclination of about 20 degrees, to prevent the grain from doubling and falling outside of the beaters. The sheaves (of about half the size of the common bundles) are then to be forced endwise under the breakers and turned, and if any heads of grain remain in the buts, they are to be suffered to pass under the cylinder.\n\nThis machine, for simplicity of construction, exceeding durability, ease and perfection of its performance, cannot be surpassed by any other work of art. \n\nThe price of a Machine with the patent right, is 60 dollars.  Counties and Towns sold upon advantageous terms.\n\nFIGURE II.\n\nBRAKE, FOR LARGE HEMP,\nBut not required for the small or ordinary sized Hemp, nor for Flax. \n\nA The Frame.\nB The Bed.\nC Fluted Roller.\nD Pendulum.\nE Pitman, which is put in motion by means of Crank F, attached to axis of the Drum G, at A, in Fig. I.\n\nThe Crank F being attached to the axis of the Drum G, sets it in motion. The small end of the hemp is first forced under the Roller C, and when broken the other end is in like manner broken. The slats in the Bed B are [MS Torn] be made from two inches and three quarters to 3 inches asunder, and the flutes of the Roller C to correspond. \n[End Page 2]"
