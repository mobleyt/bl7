      "value": "August 9, 1947\nDear Armant,\nJust returned from a theatre trip and a visit to\nthe plantation to find your letter of August 2nd.\nCertainly an sorry to hear that you are feeling so\nbadly and do hope that this matter will clear up soon. However\nMorris and I do not expect to play tennis and golf when we\narrive. We will devote ourselves entirely to pleasure which\nunfortunately now consists entirely of boasting of what we would\nlike to do. I don't see why you could not join with us in this\nrelatively simple pastime.\nThe starting of your firm is very fine and I an\ndelighted that everything is going so well and certainly hope\nit will continue. I do not see why it will not because everyone\nlikes to do business with you and they have to have coffee, I\ncould do with a big black cup right now.\nI would very mush like to send Katherine to Newcomb\nfor her first year. Providing that you will not tell her that\nI an doing it. Just let me send you a check for the amount and\nyou take care of the payment. Then by next year when you are\nmaking beaucoup money you can do it without any trouble, but right\nthis year it maybe a bit of a drag with the new business. I wish\nyou would let me do this as it would give me great pleasure,and\nwhat difference does it make where the money comes from as long as\nour children are benefitted.\nSo long, Morris and I thought of dragging you up here\nfor the party but we figured that you would be happier in the peace\nof an empty house in New Orleans with a bottle and perhaps an\nocassional female visitor, so we let the matter drop."
