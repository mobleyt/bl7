      "value": "U. S. S. CASTOR\t\tThursday , Oct 12 th. 1944.\nLt.Comdr.S.J.Legendre,USNR.\n149 East 73 rd. St. \nNew York City. \nDear Droopy Eyes-\nJust a few minutes ago the mail-man brings me\nyour letter of Oct 2 nd, and also one from the Fuhrer dated\nSept 30 th , written from Pearl before you took off for the US.\nIt so happened that only yesterday I had written a lenghthy\nmasterpiece to the Fuhrer requesting his noble assistance in\ngetting to hell out of the Navy. I sent my letter to Box 163,\nbut figuring that you both might have left, I put on the envelope\n\"Please forward\". But knowing that wild and wooly office of\nyours where everybody sits in each others laps, I fear me that\nmy letter may never be forwarded. So just to be on the safe side, \nI'm enclosing a copy of my letter herewith, also copy of my\n\"request\" and the Bureaus answer.\nIn Morrises letter, he didnt give me his address in the US,\nso I dont know if he will be in Washington, Summerville or New\nYork. On the other hand, since you have given me the above definite\naddress [ by the way what is it --- still the old Sanford house ?]\nI think best to send to you this enclosed copy. If you feel in\na Boy Scout mood and wish to do your \"good deed\" , you might\nrush down to Washington and haldle this for Arms Arman. Otherwise\n,please forward it on to the Fuhrer for his masterfull handling.\nwhen I wrote this letter yesterday, I said on Page 2 \nparagraph 3 , that I was still in an \"intraining\" status and\nhoped that the Captain would leave me so. Unfortunately , today\nhe just told me that he can no longer delay action on his request\nfor me to be made officially the Exec. He is writing the Bureau\naccordingly by todays mail. I only hope that his letter takes as\nlong to get there as it did the Bureaus reply to reach me--one\nmonth ! Anyway, no time is to be lost , as my chances of being\nreleased will be much less after I'm officially the Exec. So\nplease Sid , either you or Morris see hat you can do next time\nare in Washington. \nIf you have a chance when you are in Washington , please\ngo to Foxcroft and see my little angels. I know that they would\nlove to see you. Olive writes me that Mimi has been elected Head\nof the entire Student Body and Kafrum was elected representative\nfrom her own class. I'm so proud of em that I could pop. If you\ndo get to see them , give them both a swift kick in their fannies\nfrom their old man.\nSo long Sid , and let me hear from you when you have a\nchance and let me know your own plans. Lord knows when we will\ninto each other again, as looks like we are out here now\nfor many moons. My blessings on the Wise Men of Ala Waie\nArma Arma\nLt.Comdr.A.Legendre,USNR"
