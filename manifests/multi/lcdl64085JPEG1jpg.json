      "value": "West Point N.Y. September 3rd '52 Dear Godmother, I have just returned from the section room very hot sleepy and tired but feel a great deal revived by the bare possibility of not having to drill this evening as it has been raining and promises to do so again. if unluckily it clears up we will be drilled half to death to show off before General Scott. I believe he is here for we were made to fire a salute to day and I heard that he was expected. Our studies commenced on Wednesday, as yet we have had nothing to learn except Algebra and English Grammar, and take fencing lessons every other day. The class is at present very large numbering over ninety but there will be a great clearing out in January to judge from some of the specimens of which it is composed, who seem neither to know any thing nor to be able to learn. I am afraid that I shall have some trouble with [End Page 1] my eyes they are quite sore and painful now and studying at night will not improve them especially by the miserable light that we have, from oil lamps exactly like those Aunt Bet uses in the back room and which I was always afraid to touch and was obliged to call Charlotte to carry But now alas I have both to clean the lamp and light it. No drill this evening for it has set to work regularly to rain and it only wants half an hour of the time for drill so I can take off my padded coat and uniform corn causing shoes and enjoy a quiet evening. Many thanks for your share of the lot of goodies, the last of the syrup was drunk to day and I feel in consequence as if I had lost an old and tried friend, what with the syrup [and] and a large round wooden table which was in this room when it was used as an office, and left here, I have had plenty of company; nothing was ever more popular than Lusan's jar for after the jelly was all eaten, not having tumbler dipper or anything to drink out of I used it as a cup, the cadets prefer to drink out of it to anything else saying that it makes the [End Page 2] water taste sweet. I have not got into any trouble about my [?] as you were afraid I would. There are two Smeads here and I don't know which one you saw but can guess since I don't think that one of them was ever at a loss what to say, and is quite wild and handsome. When he came back from furlough he did not shave off his mustache when he went to report to the commandant but concealed it by covering it with writing and went to the ball that night with it on. He was of course seen there by officers and the next day was put in arrest for wearing moustache out of uniform. We were all very sorry yesterday evening for one of our cadet lieutenants who was deprived of his office for \"discourteous conduct persisting in speaking to his commanding officer\", he was one of the best officers we had and spoke to Capt Alden because he was unjustly treated about his room Capt Brewerton has been removed from this post and Col Lea placed in his stead, he is said to be one of the strictest disciplinarians in the army. I hope that mother has quite recovered from the fever and jaundice; has the summer been very hot and sickly Tell Abby I want to know which soldier boy [End Page 3] she took for me. I pity poor little Grimball when he gets under her hands I suppose the planters are busy harvesting by this time I hope the river will sustain its sinking reputation. Did Tom never finish the letter to me which I heard he had begun, I give DuGue up as a gone case; Tom Barker has written to me twice and yet he cannot find time to do so once. I have heard nothing of Mr Gay for a long time Speaking of Mr Gay reminds me that I got quite an original letter from Mr [Looms?] in which he informs me that he intends purchasing a horse and a pig the first to ride and the other to take lessons in contentment from, and to pinch his tail and make him squeal, he then goes into a long disquisition on the beauties of a squeal and concludes by quoting some poetry on the subject. It is time for me to go to my studies so I must conclude. Give my love particularly to Grandmother and tell her I will write to her soon with love to all the family and friends I remain ever Your affect Godson S. Wragg Ferguson [End Page 4]"
