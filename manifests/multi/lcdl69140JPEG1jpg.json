      "value": "December 26, 1942\nSweet Eyes,\nJust received your letter 42 of December 15th. It\nwas wonderful and I was so delighted to receive it, and to\nhear all the news about yourself and th children. Miss\nCharlotte is an amazing women and I re ly believe that she\nwill be responsible for Landine being a lovely person rather\nthan a problem child. Bo sounds beyondhelp like a naughty\npuppy that everyone loves so much they efuse to discipline.\nI wish I could see them both for a momnt, they have probably\nchanged enormously even during the shor time I have been away.\nI opened my presents yesteray at two oclock. We\nwere given half the day off and str ke home like to excited\nchildren to see what was under t ose woderful covers. You\nare a darling to send me so many presens. The four leaf clover\n[this dam machine just tore this when I threw the carri ge back]\nwas heaven. Your name and mine together with luck and happiness\nis my one wish andto have it with me in your riting means it\nwill always come true. My present from Tanny was sweet, and\ngave me quite a dig in the heart when I thought of him and his\nbig fat feet. I wonder if he was fed onlythe best steaks and\ngiven a rubber bone[,]which in these times is practically like\nsolid gold and only percurable by a Vanderbilt. Then there\nwere so many choice tidbits. Crepe suzzettes in cans, baba Rhums\ncandies, sardines etc. that I will undoubtly become a gourment\nand quite ill before they are all finished.\nThe box containing the stocking I took to the dinner\ngiven by the two officers. I had just peeked into the top of\nthis stocking and found a bar of chocol te and some figs so\nthought it was filled with these sort of things. It would\nbe fun to have the stocking at dinner and everyone could unwrapp\nas having thought of bringing it to them. It went off as planned\nuntil one officer let out a whoop and help up a tiny package\nwith a card on it. Everyone crowded around him and read in\nloud voices \"Merry Christmas to Daddy from Bo\". After that there\nwas a mad scramble as we all dove into the stocking and emerged\nwith jams, [scratched through], a wonderful set of a bottle opener and cork\nscrew from Landine and all sorts of candies. No one would\nbelieve that I had a child called Landine and they only knew\nBokara as a rug. It was great fun and added immensely to the\n[End Page 1]\ndinner.\nThe dinner was delicious, grapefruit, and then\na wonder ul twenty pound turkey cooked to a delicious goldnen\ncrispness replete with stuffing of nuts, mushrooms and marrons.\nThere were birds eye vegetables, asparagus and peas, which\nmade Morris very angry as he said though they were not strictly\nfresh they were yet tainted with freshness and therefor were\nnot of the high quality possesed by c nned goods. Your two\nplum puddings were e ten as desert and we poured rum around them\nand set it on fire as we brought it into the dinning room.\nChampagne corks flew with lous pops and Morris hit me in the\nseat of the pants with one as I was stooping over to pick up\na fork. This was the high spot of his evening and his great\nbelly shoook with laughter for hours afterwards whenever he\nremembered this coup. Finally at nine oclock we groaned home\nbut not before everyone had held forth on the war, women and\nfinance. A British Naval Officer dropped in and I was asked \nto interpret what he said as no one could understand him. They\nsaid they could understand a little of what I said even with\nmy funny accent, and that I had had some experience with the\nEnglish and might be able to understand a little of the curious\nlanguage they spoke, and therefor could relay it to a third\nmanX who boasted he could could understand me f irly well and\nwould tell everyone else what was being discussed. This\ncomplic ted system lasted only for a short time and broke\ndown very quickly as the arguments waxed hot. Knowing me\nas you do you may rest assured that I retired very quickly\nand stretched out in a chair to rest and recueperate my e ting\npowers. You would certainly have gone to town and talked them\nall down.\nEveryone is back at the office looking as if\nthey should be under a doctors c re this morning and I am\nafraid that the quality of work turned out xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nduring these sad morning hours will not be of the highest.\nI have not even a slip of aper to pretend ot be orking over\nand then the captain passed on the way to his office I just\ngave him a sad quiet look and laid my head back gently on the\ndes like a tired spaniel. Morris however is rushing round\npulling p pers out of the file and thre tening to start an\nentirely new system which if put into effect will c use a\ngreat deal of work and disrupt the tenor of office life for\nat least a week. I suppose that empire builders are constructed\nalong these line but they should not be allowed to opetate\nthe day after christmas, the possible results are too serious.\nDid you read the Furber book yousent me. It\nis halarious. I read a chapter last night before going to sleep\nit was about language books and the sentences they taught you\nto use when you went to foreign countries. Every sencence was\nbased on diaster. You were only instructed how to say to the\nchambermaid \"the sheets are dirty\", \"there is a mouse in the\nroom\". The sentences on air travel were only concerned with\n\"I am ill, give me a paper bag\", The noise is dreadful\".\nall my love\nSidney Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
