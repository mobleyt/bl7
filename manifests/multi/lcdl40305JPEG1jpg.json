      "value": "Erlangen June 11 My Dear Papa I write a budget of letters to send by the Havre steamer and the first to you. I cannot say how fortunately situated I am her among the \"[coryphaei?]\" of a German university, [illegible] [illegible] and flattering to me. I feel poorly provided with knowledge enough to keep up the interchange of thought and yet it seems am not wholly without the ability to reciprocate something interesting. I dine walk and [illegible] quite frequently and socially with the renowned professors of the German world and am quite in another atmosphere from where I ever was before. Professor Delitsch [Delitzsch] a renowned Hebrew and [Oriental?] and Hofmann who is creating a great sensation in Europe with his \"Biblical Theology,\" \"Prophecy & its fulfillment,\" \"Scripture Proof.\" His standpoint is the \"Bible\" [illegible] full[End Page 1] and are sufficient body of divinity and apparatus of proof, its own interpreter and authority. He holds himself aloof from all systems of philosophy and philosophy as subservient and not the interpreter to Christianity. Professor Schmid is a renowned church historian and from him I learn much of the new schools of theology. Professor Nagelsbach is another man of wide fame here in Europe. He is one of the first [Philogians] and has written a remarkable work \"The Homeric Theology\" in which he examines the theological tenets of the greeks and shows the insufficiency & defect of the system compared to the Christian. All of his works have a Christian tendency & some call him the \"Theological Philogian\" although he is no Theologian. I heard here recently in a open & public disputation with[End Page 2] communication for the paper in Charleston & this I have heard nothing of. It is no loss if it has never came to light. I have a reluctance to send & publish to the world my [illegible] judgments of German affairs am can just being fully initiated into a full understanding of their peculiarities. Do give my love & kind remembrances to all of my relations and friends. I would like to pop in at the old house and see you all there. I really hope this summer will not be so sickly and disastrous to crops as the last. We are here now anxiously awaiting further news from Sebastopol. Considerable[End Page 3] advantages have been won, and there seems like little doubt of its fall & a following peace. When the girls write to town beg them to send my sincerest love to Aunt Mathews and ask Ted if he has got my last letter over Liverpool. I am here living economically and still comfortably & feel deeply grateful to God and friends for the priviledges [sic] I am enjoying. With constant prayers for all of you at home I am your affec son R. W. Barnwell[End Page 4]"
