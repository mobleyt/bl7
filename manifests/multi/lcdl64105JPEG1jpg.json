      "value": "An Extract from a letter of Henrietta C. Heyward. written a month before her death I have been very much interested my dear Grandmother, in reading Winslow on the Holy Spirit. I must earnestly pray for the indwelling of it, and the sealing, in fact the whole so far as I have read. I always feel as I read, could I only enjoy these blessings and these comforts there expressed; sometimes I feel ready to give up, because I find myself so wicked, so prone to sin, but there is something bidding me press on. Jesus saved the thief on the cross, and he can save me, his love is too great for us to comprehend. I have no doubt you have been surprised at my always avoiding to express my feelings on this subject while with you, but I seldom or ever express these on any occasion, for I always find I have nothing to say, except that I feel myself a sinner, and my need of a Saviour, very great. but I have a horror of being a hypocrite or a disgrace to the profession for I often know my conduct does not exactly coincide with what I really feel, but you know my situation as well as I, and all [End Page 1] I have to withstand and bear with. You know I often used to think were I only poor and living in some obscure place how I would love the Saviour, but it is not so now. I feel the Almighty has placed me purposely where I am to try my faith, and even were I alone, I could not love and adore my Saviour unless the Spirit moved my heart to do so, and that he can in his own appointed time do so now. I have never thought my self what I considered converted, but during the last three years I have had a dread of the Almighty, that I never felt safe or happy any where. I knew I was sinning and did not know what to do, but it is not so now though I see my way but darkly. still I cant but hope the prayers offered for me by my Mother in my childhood have been in some way answered and although I feel myself more of a sinner every day, still I think it must be the Spirit which moveth me to prayer to hope and to hate sin. I daresay you all think me slow in progress, but such my path appears to me to be, but I sincerely hope [?] long to be classed among you all pressing on to the everlasting crown. I shall read Bickerstith as soon as I finish Winslow and have no doubt I shall be interested. With much love I remain your Affec. Grand daughter Henrietta Rose Hill December 13th 1846. [End Page 2] Beaufort March 17th 1848 My Dear Maria When I was at Clay Hall your Mama told me you were so much fascinated with Sr [sister?] Henriettas letter, that you said you would like to have copy of it, so I send you one, and hope My Dear James may be led through your influence to be interested too in it and the subject it embraces. I hope you have all been well and once I left that part of the country, I was sorry to hear through Caroline that your Mama was so much indisposed as to be in bed the day she went to see them. I hope by this time she has been able to go to Town and that Hetty is now getting about but I have had no letter from there, I have myself been much indisposed from a cold. With much love I am Your Affectionate Grandmother NB [End Page 3] BEAUFORT S.C. MAR 18 Mrs James B Heyward Care of Nath Heyward Senr Blue House So Ca Mail [End Page 4]"
