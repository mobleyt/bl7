So long ago as the year 1782 or 83, Josiah Smith of Charleston, then with his family in Philad: seeing us in the wire Business advised us to turn our attention to a wire work suitable for dressing rice. We told him it was our professional Business and nothing more was necessary than to give us Samples of the Subject or grains to be separated: that we could ready ascertain the Mesh [and] were in the constant habit of doing it for every purpose to which that kind of work could be applied. He furnished us with Samples of Rice from which We discovered the requisite Mesh of them in the year 1783, made for his Son Samuel Smith a number of sieves for dressing Rice, and since then for him [and] other persons in Charleston a considerable number. Sometime in the year 1790 James Dillet then a Stranger to us called at our Shop [and] inquired whether we could invent or make a machine for dressing Rice. We told him it was our regular trade, entirely in the line of our business to make machines for all kinds of Grain that there was no invention necessary, that We had long been in the practice of making rolling Screens [and] rolling Sifters on a variety of constructions and for a variety of purposes, that We had several years before that calculated the Meshes suitable for rice, at the instance of a gentleman then here in exile from Charleston and for whose Son as well as for others We had made a considerable quantity of wire for the purpose. Nothing more relative to the business passed at this time. Some short time after in the same year he called again [and] offered if we would make a Machine for William Alston, charge it to Wm. Alston, send it on our own risque and in case Alston did not like it, take it back again, he would take one with him [and] try it, to this we agreed, and to the best of our recollection, recommended one of the plain simple tossing kind, six square, made in the manner of the common bolting\n[End Page 1]\nBolting frame and such as is now in use in Carolina for rice Screens. At the same time we showed him a wheat rolling Screen of a double kind, that is one coat of wire at some distance within the other, which We had invented about three years before and which answered to great satisfaction for cleaning wheat. On this double construction, owing to his preference of it, the one for Alston was made [and] sent with Dillet.\n\nEarly in the Spring of 91, we received an order from B: Shoemaker of Philad: for a rolling Screen similar to a wheat rolling Screen, but to be covered with wire for dressing Rice: this We made on the oldest fashion, a plain single tossing Screen, six square similar to the Bolting Frame from a persuasion that it would answer better, than the double construction: this was forwarded to B: Smith Esq. of Wilmington No: Carolina on the 19th April 1791. Sometime after this in the same year 1791, Dillet brought back [and] delivered to us the Screen sent to Alston, said he had tried it, but found the Straws, collected and lodged between the inner [and] outward coats of wire, So as to prevent its working to advantage. We received it and gave Alston credit in the same amount in which it was charged to him. And here the Business with Dillet seemed to cease. We had no prospect of any further intercourse or correspondence with him. June 23rd 1792 on the personal application of Thomas Pinckney Esq. We made for him a single tossing rolling Screen for cleaning rice on the same construction with that made for Benj: Smith, and this is the first or oldest screen in South Carolina.\nSept: 30th: 1794 We made a Set of wire work of the same Meshes to cover a Screen of the same construction for dressing Rice for a person of the name of Drury, We understood a South Carolina gentleman. Octo: 15th: 1794 Dillet comes forward again and ordered some wire work to cover a small rolling Screen of the same simple construction for cleaning Rice before it goes into the pounders that is for cleaning rough Rice. One part of this wire was, such as in the middle part of the machines, which dress the Rice after Shelling. The other was of our common wheat rolling Screen, Ridling wire \n[End Page 2]\n[and] what had been made for that purpose. This wire was the first of Dillet's introduction into Carolina, which remains there in use [and] must have been after the introduction of both Pinckney's [and] Drury's into South Carolina, [and] that of Benj. Smith's into No. Carolina, [and] we know of no hand or agency, whatever of Dillet's in the introduction of these three Screens. Nay we don't recollect of ever hearing of him, from the time he brought back the one made for Alston in the year 1791, until he called on us for the rough Rice work Oct: 1794.\n\nThe next rough rice work we made was of the same kind by order of W. Bell of Philad [Philadelphia] for whom we do not know. This was made Octo [October] 1796 with two Screens for dressing shelled Rice. Since this we have made a considerable number for dressing both shelled [and] rough Rice, without ever having had the most distant idea of Dillet's claiming either the Invention or introduction of these machines, for surely he is entitled to neither the one or the other.\n\nIn April 1799, we received a Letter from [illegible] Herriot of Georgetown inclosing Dillet's advertisement of his patent machine, among which was included our Rice rolling Screens. We were astonished at the man's presumption. We recollect his saying something about some machinery he was trying to erect for shelling Rice, and that he hoped to succeed in it, [and] if so to get a patent for it, but why include our work in the invention or perfection of which he had not the smallest hand, but entirely relied on our skill [and] judgment, in all the work he has taken, except in the construction of the one taken for Alston, [and] returned on account of the construction. Nay he depended in no small degree on what We could do in dressing the Rice to aid [and] establish his works for Shelling it.\n\nThe six square rolling Screen is probably the invention of many Centuries ago, the application of them to different purposes is a thing of course, which has nothing to do with invention.\n\nIn answer to thy Question, relative to the rolling Screens for cleaning wheat, we beg leave to inform thee that our Father John Sellers was the first person who took up the wire work or screen making in America about 44 years ago, at which time he also built a Grist and Merchant Mill about six miles from Philad [Philadelphia] and we believe the first rolling Screens he made, [and] the first made in America of wire was put up in his Mill upwards of 40 years ago, which answering a very valuable purpose [and] becoming known\n[End Page 3]\nknown brought him many applications for them. About the same time he began to make rolling Screens, for cleaning flaxseed, with equal success [and] continued the Business until the Revolutionary War put a stop to improvements of that kind, for several years. After the War we commenced the same business, (one of us having been brought up to it by him) [and] considerably improved it, constantly studying to apply it, to every purpose which in its nature, it is capable of effecting: and great attention (We can say without boasting) have we paid to the improvements [and] perfection of it [and] with equal success. And no inconsiderable part of our Reward is, that they are useful to the purchasers. As to asking a patent for them We (to whom surely if to any Body is ought to have been granted) have never an idea of the kind, wishing them to come into use, on as moderate terms as possible. Judge then what our feelings must be, to know that a Man who cannot have the Shadow of a Claim to any such thing, should saddle our work with unnecessary Expenses [and] extort a Reward for what? That which never cost him a Farthing, not even a thought!\n\nWe have enquired of Oliver Evans, the Date of his patent for the Elevators, and find it January 1791, we think the 7th January. \n\nWe hope thee will pardon the length of this communication [and] believe us with the greatest Respect.\n\nThy [illegible] friends\n(signed) N. [and] D. Sellers.\n\n[End Page 4]"
