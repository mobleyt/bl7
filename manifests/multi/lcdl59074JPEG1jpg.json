      "value": "March 23, 1944  MEMORAMDUM TO: Members of the Civic Services Committee  There will be a meeting of the committee at the Gibbes  Art Gallery on Tuesday, March 28th, at five p.m.  George W. Simons, Jr., retained by the committee as  Consultant on city planning, will attend the meeting.  Mr. ace and Mr. Whitelaw will expain objectives.  ew members will have an opportunity to state their  views.  Mr. Simons has many matters to present before the  committee, which include the following taken from a recent  letter from him:  \"I referred in ourdiscussions to the necessity of  making a study of traffic flow and composition as we as prevailing parking practices, a study of traffic flow would definitely revea the circuation habits of the city and what  thoroughfares are most extensivey used. Such a study offers  an opportunity to draft into service a number of oder high  sohoo boys or Boy Scouts who could do the job pursuant to  instructions and under committee guidance. The intensity and  volume of traffic flowing today may not be typioa of norma  conditions but nevertheess it would present somewhat of a  picture of what might be expected under norma conditions.  It  would at least give a basic picture of what is taking place  now in the community.  \"A study of prevailing- parking practices would necessitate a number of studies, among them, a review of existing  ordinances reating to planting and the estobisbment of restricted  or load ng zones, also a study of and acquisition under the  right of eminent domain in South Carolina. This work could be  undertaken by some individual on the committee, preferaby a  awyer.  \"harry in the work it would be desirable to have a  map prepared on which could be shown by suitable designation  the uses of a ands.  This would constitute an existing conditions map and should be prepared by a draftsman or artist  working under the direction of some committee representative  or group, from such a map the present Intensity of and use  could be determined also the avaliability of areas best suited  for acquisition and development as off-street parking areas.  \"A survey should be made to ascertain the number and  ocation of a Public storage garages, of mechanical garages  and of parking lots under private operation. Among other things\n\n[End Page 1]\nthe storage capacity of these various utiities ehoud be  determined. And in this connection, it would not be amiss to  ascertain the avaliability of private residential garage  storage capacity. Suppementing these various studies, the  inea footage of curb parking space should be determined  excusive of restricted zones, alley and buiding entrances,  fire pugs and service station entrances. Much of this could  be scaed or measured from the existing conditions map and  checked against actua measurements on the ground.  \"Another important map that might be prepared would  show the values of properties in different parts of the city.  This would be determined from records in the tax office. This  would be a and value map.  \"The more you expore the many items on which to  predicate any recommendations, other questions arise such as  what disposition will be made of tenants now living in congested areas that might subsequenty be ceared or be converted  into offstreet parking areas? As the survey progresses and  the facts are brought forth the matter of graphic presentation  arises. Certainy a group can develop ways and me ps to best  present the findings to the citizenry.  \"In addition to the many foregoing subjects there  are a number of general items that must also be considered  such ae population distribution and growth, the trend of  buiding development, etc.\"  Submitted by,  Robert N.S. Whitelaw  Director  \n\n[End Page 2]"
