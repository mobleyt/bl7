      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent /SC April 27th 1858 My Dearest Brother I wrote you a few lines on the day before yesterday, but I have come to the conclusion that you had left for the Council before they could reach you therefore I will now say a few words I did not know when to address you in Baltimore, so I hope you will excuse me for sending this in Sister's envelope. It has occurred to me my dear Brother that if we could go down in the latter part of July or in August while the exercises of the Academy are suspended, and the greater part of the Children at home it would be advisable and more satisfactory to our good Mother Superior and ourselves We will all unite our prayers and communion on the 3rd day Pray for your own sister Ella de Baptiste [End Page 1] that to delay until the return of the children and c. -We would be plan to have a month to prepare before opening our school, and I think the sooner now that we begin our work the better. What do you think?-It seems to me also that if you could withdraw after the Council come and away matters satisfactorily-or at least as soon as you know the decision of the Springfield community, which I suppose when the Bishop returns will be given, we could see our way more clearly, and make the necessary preparations, which we will want some time for-Then at the time of our going down you could send some one to take care of our baggage which is all that will be necessary. But should you delay coming until you intend us to return with you (which may be the best) you will be detained here at least a week for we can do nothing decisive until you come [End Page 2] I never intend to disguise myself as a secular again when traveling. So I think I will assume the costume of the \"Sisters of Charity [marked out] Mercy of Charleston\" which is so universally known and respected throughout the U. States What do you think of it-I will reserve until I see you my dearest Brother all that I would say of your consecration-good Archbishop [End Page 3] Rt Revd Philip Neri Lynch D. D.
