Edward May 14th 1781\nDr. General,\nYou have no doubt expected the\nMilitia from this State before this.  In the\nfirst place they have in general manifested\nan uncommon reluctance in marching to your\nArmy – arising I apprehind [sic] from two causes –\nFirst the season of the Year, [and] secondly the lengthy\nmarch into a hot [and] disagreeable Country, which \nclimate of which they entertain horrid ideas\nof.  From the movements of Cornwallis [and]\nPhillips, it appears certain, that they mean to\nmake this State the Scene of the Southern war\nthis Campaign:   The Executive impriss'd [sic] with\nthis idea, have order'd me to stay here, together\nwith such militia order'd to join you, [and] who\nhave not actually march'd.  I have reason\nto imagine that there are now at Salisbury\nupwards of 500 men. Colo. [Colonel] Cocke who was\nin Gl. Stevens Brigade is order'd by me to that\nplace\n[End Page 1]\nplace to arrange the militia there collected, [and] await\nyour orders.\nI have no doubt but that you'll direct\nyour course this way, should Cornwallis move into\nThis State – which seems not to be doubted at present.\nShould the Event prove other wise, the militia first\norder'd will join you with all possible dispatch.\nI must beg you'll do me the honor in the\nmean time, of giving me such orders as you may see\ncause, which shall be obey'd with alacrity.\nThe Marquiss [sic] is on the North side of James\nRiver, with the whole of the Troops collected in this\nState. The Enemy are on the South Side, at liberty\nto go where they please, [and] are doing all possible injury\nto our the unfortunate [and] defenceless [sic] Inhabitants who\nfall in their way – Indeed I cannot avoid expressing\nmy ardent wish, that you were with your Troops in this\nState. I am confident it would change the face of\nthings greatly in our favor – and it is not only mine, but\nthe\n[End Page 2]\nthe anxious wish of Virga. that this should\nbe the case.   The Enemy have already done us\ninexprissible [sic] Injury, by burning our Tobacco, [and]\ntaking [and] destroying our Magazines of Provisions\ncollected at different places on James [and]\nAppomatox [Appomattox] Rivers.\nThe militia are order'd to the\namount of about 1000 to rendezvous at the\nCourt House of this County; to join the Mar-\nquiss in opposing the progress of the Enemy in this\nState, or to march to you as exigencies may\nrequire [ink blot] I beg again your particular instruc\n-tions – and I have the honor to be with the\nhighest respect,\nSir\nYour most obed.t humble Serv.t [obedient humble Servant]\nRo: Lawson B. G.enl. [Robert Lawson Brigadier General]\n[End Page 3]\n[Addressed:]\nOn public service\nThe Honble [Honorable]\nMajor General Greene\nTo be forwarded by\nExpress from Salisbury.\nHead Quarters.\n[seal]\n[Endorsed: upside down]\nfrom Genl. [General] Lawson\nMay 14th. 1781 -\n[End Page 4]"
