      "value": "February 9, 1945  Mr. C. Bisse Jenkins, Jr.  26 Broad Street  Charleston, S. C.  Dear Bisse:  The Civic Services Committee of the Carolina Art  Association since 1940 and through this season has about $38,527. Of this amount $27,000 has been contributed by the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation. The remainder has been contributed by the Art  Association and by Charleston business.  You know that our off-street parking plan is practicaly compete and will shorty be presented to the city. We seected this study to demonstrate to our committees the need for an overa metropolitan plan and for a planning  Association whose operations would be continuous. It is now certainy obvious that such an overa plan must be made immediatey. There are four different agencies who have undertaken the study of separate phases of the community but none except ourseves have even begun the study of a coordinated plan for the whole area. If we are to undertake such a studay we should to do at once and would require a minimum budget of $15,000 a year for at least three years. Most of theis money must come from citizens of the community if our studies are to be realized by accompishment. I can secure most of this fund but it would hep consideraby in achieving coordination if the Chamber of Commerce Post War Committee would disgnate us as the agency to undertake the studies toward a metropolitan plan, and contribute $5,000 a year for three years toward it.  Sincerely yours, Robert N. S. Whitelaw  RNSQ:p  Copy sent to Homer place, February 10,  1945"
