      "value": "Scat [drawing of a cat] Island January 30th 1862 My Dear Daughter I am greatly at a loss to know why this place is called Cat Island, it worries me sometimes till I cant sleep. Why there aint a cat on it, and it don't look like there ever was, and I have come to the conclusion that for this Very reason the gave it that name. Now if they had called it Flea Island, then I could have understood it. My very legs understands the meaning of the word Flea, and sometimes my feet want to Flee away from the Fleas, and remain away till the Fleas have all Fled [Fleed]. I never saw such Whoppers they make ridges on the top of the ground like moles only not quite so large. I cant see what makes them so fond of this place there is no Hogs, no Dogs and no Cats here for them to play with and I am sure I did not ask the unmannerly things into my Tent. Well when I move into my new House, I intend to Kick the first one out that puts his foot inside the Door if I can. There is a Creek about half a mile from the Fort call Musqueto [Mosquito] Creek and I can\n[End Page 1]\nunderstand that too. such Busters and so numerous, and they can sing Dixie almost as good as the Negroes that are at work on the Fort. How they do swarm here about sundown but when I move I will get rid of them by putting my Musqueto [Mosquito] Bar around my Cot. We are getting ready to give old Burnside a few Balls if he comes up here we want to see how he can dance. The people in Georgetown are dreadfully frightened for fear we will be sent to North Carolina Your Uncle Henry has just got back from there and says they are getting up a Petition to the Colonel asking him not to leave here Just like he could do as he pleased about it if Davis says go he will have to go Georgetown or no Georgetown. Surely the People in Town don't think much of Harllees Legion or they would feel safe with them. Well I know the 10th Regiment can whip Burnsides and get done time enough to cook supper before sun down. do write to me and let me Know how you are and how Ned and that little Pint are and anything else that you will write Goodby My Daughter Your Father who wants to see you John R Beaty\n[End Page 2]"
