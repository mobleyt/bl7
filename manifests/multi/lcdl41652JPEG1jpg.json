      "value": "Columbia July 28th 1859 Dear Brother I mentioned to you when I send you the MS that the American Hotel was for sale, I went today to look at it, was pleased, reported to Sister Ellen who appeared equally pleased. I now wish you to pass your opinion (leaving out the views), which you cant do without taking an inside view of it, but, I will give you some idea before hand, it is situated on Richardson, Blanding, and Marion (I believe)sts, on Richardson one Hundred and _ ft, on Blanding the side of a square, on Marion 1/2 square-a plot something like this diagram, you will know it by reference to the map as marked. J Boatwright, They say it has seventy rooms, besides passages &c, my reason for writing this hurriedly is that you may not compromise [End Page 1] yourself in the other case, before looking at this. I have tried to see Dr. Boatwright before writing but have failed. I know the place can be bought for eighteen thousand but I intend trying to see what fifteen will do, I know they don't want the money, as it is an estate property and by making them perfectly secure may be bought at eight or ten year time this is something I will write you again as soon as I have more, if I do not see you first, practice is tolerably brisk, prospects fair, if I don't get along it is my own fault, pray that I may your affectionate brother John All well at the convent and home, only two of our children complaining, Anna and Hugh gone home. Rt Revd Bishop Lynch DD Charleston SC. [End Page 2] 28 July 1859 Dr John Lynch Cola. [End Page 3]"
