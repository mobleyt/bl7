  "description": "Work on paper in watercolor and ink dated 1796. Large, white Georgian style two story house is fronted by a clear blue stream. In this frontal view, the symmetrical house has two chimneys and four windows on each floor. First floor has elaborate double door while immediately above it on second floor, there is an elaborate window. House is sided by a less ornate taupe building to its left, half hidden by a grove of trees. To the main house's right, a smaller brick support building stands behind an impressive brick and iron gate. Horse-drawn carriage is found waiting outside of the gate. Water visible in background to right of smaller building. Grass visible in foreground, between viewer, water, and house.",
