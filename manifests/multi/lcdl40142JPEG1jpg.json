      "value": "16 Sept 1837 My dear Brother I have not felt well today but as I wish to write to Stephen on Monday and our mail arrangements do not permit one who writes [illegible] to finish two letters in the morning I write now. We thank you dear Brother for the comfort. Which your letters have afforded us in our heavy bereavement and we pray that our God may keep and support you in peace. Our dear Sisters were greatly overwhelmed on hearing of Mary's death. Sister Nancy had entertained not [illegible] that she should be [illegible] permitted to see her face In the flesh to her therefore the shock was very dreadful but our gracious Master has visited his weak and suffering and friend and servant and she is wonderfully supported. The account of deceased [illegible] holy and happy departure has brought to her sweet [illegible]. God has dealt with her in many griefs but [illegible] deeply drank of by her spirit shines brighter [illegible] by day in her life and conversation. [illegible] dear Sister Betsy feels the trail a most heavy one [illegible] loved most fondly and was greatly beloved. There has [illegible] and confidence in their intercourse ready with [illegible] But that Lord. Where she is and whom she [serves?] [illegible] to her sorely tried spirit assurances of[End Page 1] and suffering love. Giving her to know that now as on earth \"having loved his own which were in the world he [illegible] these into the end...I wish that you could soon pay her a visit for she yearns after the children of her youth and the others are not. But God has taken them, may his name be praised forever more. We are going fast dear Brother but blessed be God we [illegible] where we are going. God has been very good to me for whilst he has been setting my secret sins in the light of his countenance and been keeping me very low he has given me strong assurances of his love and [illegible] views of his love in Jesus. How shall we speak his praise dear Brother the sweetness and the grandeur of his goodness. Pray for us all dear Brother and for me that my life may be a life of love and of labour for him. The Boat did not arrive in Beaufort untill eight at night but Dr Fuller advised us that the [illegible] immediately committed to the earth. With a few male [illegible] I attended her to the grace. The moon was very bright and we [illegible] land her near those whom she loved on earth and who now love her in heaven. She will arise this is our hope and our joy You are often in my thoughts dear Brother and I have [illegible] you before the throne of [illegible] and prayed most earnestly that we be enabled [illegible] love each other less in ourselves and more in Jesus. So that even [illegible] affection may become gracious and every wish [illegible] and ourselves may magnify him our dearly loving [illegible] our dearly beloved friend and Brother. How good has our God been to us as a family not only does [illegible] sustain in death those Whom he has called but to us [illegible] how pleasant does he make the thought of death and the [illegible] heaven. The departing footsteps of those whom our thoughts [illegible] to, are radiant with the light of Paradise[End Page 2] Can you not accompany Catherine in her visit to Beaufort? Mr Walker told me the other day that he would exchange with you when you wished to pay a visit to Beaufort. It was not in reference to this particular visit that he spoke. I cannot therefore say positively whether the exchange would [suit?] him at that time but I have no doubt but that he would be [then?] willing. It is on our Sisters account that I speak, although I think that the change would also relieve you. I hope that God may bless this death to your people and to the church here. I have been hearing constantly lately in my mind's hearing that awful sublime, and affecting remark of Cousin Finley to John Stuart, \"Oh John you don't know how much I care for souls!\" Give my most affectionate love to her and [illegible] prayers for me. I was sorry to learn through Mrs [illegible] that [Resonance?] was not well. I trust [illegible] with God and in time as in eternity can praise his [illegible] my affectionate love to Catherine. I know that this [illegible] heavily upon her, for she who is gone was a Sister in heart to all Who were bound to her in the ties of earthly connection. May our blessed [illegible] manifest himself to her in her affliction and dry all tears of earthly sorrow. Kiss the children. I long to see you all very much but our time for rest and peace and union in Jesus is not yet come with [illegible]. When we get home we will rejoice to gather and tell [illegible] \"For here we have no continuing City but we seek one to [illegible] 18th. [illegible] with the exception of myself are well. I am not [mind?] [illegible] troubles with a cough and cold. Dear Brother pray [illegible] that I may be strengthened to be the will of God. [illegible] Affectionate Brother RWBarnwell[End Page 3] To The Revnd Wm H Barnwell Charleston So Carolina[End Page 4]"
