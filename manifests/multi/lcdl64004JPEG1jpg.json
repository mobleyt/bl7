      "value": "My Dear Father Paris 28th Jan. 1812  Another opportunity offers of writing you from France by the American Sloop of War the Hornet. My next communication will probably be from England, for which I propose embarking in the course of a month or six weeks. This plan I have determined upon for several reasons. First, that our tour to Italy being completely abandoned, the time of my stay in Paris will have expired. Secondly, that the season of the year will be very pleasant in London, and the summer will remain for a tour through Scotland or Wales. But principally that I may have an opportunity of returning into the hands of Mr. Tuvers, his letter of credit for a thousand pounds, which is now bearing a consuming interest against me. This I hope will rid me of any charge of imprudence, which you might have imputed to me in this affair. As it will appear that the money has neither been rashly borrowed, nor improperly applied.    I do not leave Paris without the anticipation of returning at some future day. The difficulty of communication between London and Paris, has been very much magnified by travellers; the fact is, that a jaunt from one of these cities, to the other,  [End Page 1]is no more to a young man with proper passports, than to move your family from Charleston to Combahee; the obstructions which you hear of are totally ideal. Paris contains now many Americans; some with their wives, some with their families, some upon speculation, some for pleasure; all feel the charming effect of those salutary laws, which give every encouragement to strangers to visit their delightful spot. It affords health to the old, instruction to the young, and pleasure to the middle-aged; it yields an inexhaustible source of improvement and amusement, to the lover of the fine arts; the statuary and the paintings stand unrivalled; for the scholar there is food for the deepest research.    The best piece of the Louvre is said to be the transfiguration by Sanzio Raphael; who lived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The picture represents upon the Summit of Mount Tabor Jesus conversing with Moses and Elija, the light which emanates from his person dazzles the Apostles St. Peter St. James and St. John. Near to the disciples at the foot of the mountain, is one possessed by horrible convulsions, whom they desired to cure. The Disciples are pointing to Christ as the only one who can perform this miracle. [End Page 2]I conclude this description by saying according to my author.- C'est a la Victoire, que la France doit ce chef d'oeuvre qui lui etait destine. There are many other pieces by the same pencil which are excessively fine. Among the German school Pierre Paul Rubens is considered the first. His paintings are chiefly from scripture; Such as the Flagelation of our Saviour; the elevation, upon the cross; the descent; the [?]; the visitation. The Magdalen, the Virgin, St. John, and the Disciples seized with horror at the moment the centurion pierced the side of Jesus crucified between two thieves. Some of his pieces are allegorical; as the opening of the temple of Janus, a woman is extending her arms towards heaven, neither the Graces, nor Venus, can retain Mars, who is followed by Discord, and preceded by the Furies. He treads under foot [?], the Arts, and his sword is already stained with human blood. I will not recapitulate to you the performances, of van der Poel, of Barthelemy Boehm, of Francois Porbus, of Jean Van Huysum, of Guerard Honthorst, of Pierre de Hooge, nor of Nicolas Poussin, Charles de la Fosse, or Noel Coypel. Suffice it to say that the Louvre which is a quarter of a mile in length, is filled on both sides with the master pieces of the Italian, German, and French schools, the Station is considered the best, and  [End Page 3]the German next. The gallery is open every day to strangers, and twice a week for the citizens. A little man at the door sells you a book upon your entrance, which, as the pictures are all numbered, gives you a description of the piece, and the name of the Author. It was in this gallery that the Parisians gave a dinner to the Empereur when First Consul- Think of a dinner table a quarter of a mile in length, and in such an apartment! Was not that a feast?  Although my Mother desired that I should not send her a likeness of myself until one year after my departure; yet I have ventured to have a piece finished for her by a Parisian artist; that she may have an opportunity of comparing the French, with the English painting. It should be delayed according to her request for more than a year; but probably another opportunity will never occur, and I hope this circumstance will [?] my excuse for thus hurrying it upon her - I am my Dear Father  Yr. Affectionate Son  N. Heyward Junr.  P.S. The account of the English army at Valencia under General Blake being captured by Marshal Suchet has just been recd. in Paris - joy very great. [End Page 4]"
