      "value": "29\nAugust 1, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nI have just put down the phone and am still\nsmiling. It was such fun talking to you, and you have not\nchanged a bit. I had imagined after leaving Washington you\nwould just lie on the beach at Watch Hill and rest and sleep\nfor ever. Instead I find you back in your old stamping\ngrounds on the island full of vim and vigor.\nUnfortunately I do not appe r to be able to\nclear up a misunderstanding on your part that I am a sun bunred\ngreek God comming ashore on a sr_fboard strumming a guitar\nin one hand while I use the other ot give emphasis to the\nwide variety of hula steps that I am cognizant of. I am so\nafraid that you have let your immagination run away with you\nthat when you see me again it will be quite a shock to\nfind what I re[a]lly look like, and learn that I cannot do all\nthe wonderful things that you now give me credit for.\nI am the same man who use to have indegestion after meals,\nis so sleepy by nine oclock that he has to go to bed, does not\nwant to go out to dinner and shuts his ears when people talk\ninformational interesting talk. I am tall and skinny except\nthat I now have quite a little pot and an enormous derriere.\nThis is the\"me\" you are going to see again so for goodness\nsade don't start as picturing me as a movie hero because you\nwill never survive the shock.\nYour trip is certainly cockeyed but do not worry\nyou will get off after a while. Transportation is that way.\nThey keep you waiting in the port for weeks some time and then\nsuddenly you are told to be a board in half an hour. However\naccording to you the war is almost over and there is very little\nleft but the shouting. Maybe the shouting will be the worst part.\nThe point I was trying to bring out was that maybe the war is\nover in Europe, you should know more about that than I do ,\nbut the war is not even beggining in the Pacific. Do you realize\nwe are still fooling around the Solomon Islands, if you think \nthat means a quick victory we have no meeting of minds on that \nsubject. Also common sense will tell you that when the papers\nreport ten jap ships sunk some American ships must have gone down\nin the battle. I of course hope it will be over soon and am\nvery much encouraged by what you have to say about it.\nPollys house sounds wonderful and that enourmous\nroom must have been heaven to sleep in , especially after the\nheat of Washington. How in the world does she have servants.\nI thought they did not exist any longer, a vanished race of\npeople. Out here they are now unknown, I believe there is\none stuffed one in the museum that people stare and g ape at, but\n[End Page 1]\nthere are no live ones.\nMorris just came back from the movies and said\nthey were terrible. He wanted to know all the news and\nwhat you had to say, and asked if I had r emembered to gi e you\nhis love, which I had failed to do, so I send it to you\nnow.\nGoodbye darling,\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
