      "value": "Camp Norman North Island February 18 1861 My Dear Wife After four repeated efforts I am now at 10 oâ€™clock at night blessed with silence and the opportunity of writing to you. This is the worse place to write at that ever I was in yet. I think when I get Home you will never hear me complain of noise again. It seems to me that all of my Room Mates have fully made up their minds to have no earthly use for their toungs [tongues] after they leave here and are running a race to see which one can wear out his tounge [tongue] first, if it were possible to write all that is said here in one day, and have it printed it would make more Books than ever you saw in your life, and if you were punished by reading them you would not find a wise or sensible word in the whole of them. Yesterday was cold, cold, cold, and after Breakfast, we made up a fire, closed the Door and spent a couple of Hours more sensibly than any I have spent here yet. Reading the Bible. We formed a circle and each man got out his Bible and we took it Sunday School fashion a verse each all round. We read about a Dozen Chapters this way and its solemn influence seemed to prevade [pervade] our little circle. I hope so at least. Our men are really suffering with cold, not a Blanket has yet been furnished them by the State. Alston has\n[End Page 1]\nthe Nina chartered at $150 per day to carry him from Bulls Bay to Georgetown. One half of this money would give us a Blanket a piece and yet when Capt. Norman asks for Blankets for his men, Alston says I can't give them it is too expensive. One man Jacobs has been nearly dead since he has been here, brought on by cold, the poor man did not have a Blanket or a change ofClothes when he came. My Mess gave him a pair and he is now recovering. The Small Pox is raging in Georgetown. 24 cases reported to the Board of health this morning, and Jim Molloy staid there last night and will be sure to carry it to Conway Boro. Don't go out anywhere for one week after he comes home. Don't let Ned go in the Boro. I am sure it will break out in our Camp as there is constant passing from here to Georgetown. I was vaccinated on the boat coming down and my arm is still quite sore. I hope to escape it. We are not only suffering for Clothing but will soon suffer for food, there is only two days provisions in the Camp and when this is gone, Heaven only knows what then, if the people at Home knew our situation surely they would send us something to eat. Potatoes would be greatfully [gratefully] received. I have not herd a word from you since I left Home. Do write me a long letter and let me know how all are. Yours, John R. Beaty\n[End Page 2]"
