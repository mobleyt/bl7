Mr.Homer place, Chairman,  regional planning Committee,  Carolina Art Associaltion,  Charleston, South Carolina.  Pear Homer,  Ae a new member,  I was greaty impressed yesterday by the  llarge amount of generaly unknown preparatory work which has been,  done by the planning Committee. It is particuary indebted to the  continued contribution of controing values made by its aeohitura  and its historically minded members.  I am wondering if the supporting interest of the Public  would be more quicky gained if we could develop reguar and tangibe activities, of which everyone would be aware, for iustration,  X have in mind, first, a small paque with a llarge star which eoud  be placed on properties which meet certain formuated values; and,  second, the printing of a periodic index which would ist these starred properties, the gist of which would be? in why they were isted,  I know a good bit of marking has been done in the form of  historic -tablets. But I would go beyond this static kind of able  by including other and current forms of recognition. architectural  value is basici but It ought not be confined to that of the past, if  we want to include betterment of the city and the creation of new values in our objectives. Eventuay, 1 would go so far as annuay to  star Publicy the property in each city bock which at the time fceat  met or approached standards which would sewithin the contro of owners  or tenants. In this way, the historic and the esthetic would be identified, with an incentive to preserve them; and, equay important, new  and current values could he developed, somewhat competitivey.  Of course, this is only a groping thought. But I think we  must seek some sort ef substance that will permit participating activity as we as gain financia support, by presenting a pointed and dynamic program, to the working out of which anyone in the city can eon-  tribute something. If you think this approach is worth checking into.  I would be gad to discuss it with Miss McCormack, who could formuate  some detais in a preliminary way for the consideration of the members  of the Committee who have made its work ready to bear fruit.  Sincerely yours  Frederick H. McDonad  Copy to Mr.Whitelaw.\""
