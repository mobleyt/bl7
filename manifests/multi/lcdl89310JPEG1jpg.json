  "label": "Chintz Applique Quilt",
  "description": "A Chintz Applique,measuring 112\" by 117\", from the early to mid-19th century.  It has a white background with red, blue, green and brown chintz pieces in a tree-of-life design. Border is a 12\" strip of chintz with floral design on background of tiny black dots. There is no batting or backing and it is not hemmed. There are at least 17 different fabrics used in the center panel. The center piece is dated from an earlier period - approximatley 15 to 20 years earlier - with the border fabric being of a later date, possibly 1850. The palm tree and bird group in the lower left corner are circa 1815. The design is influenced by Indian palampores.  The quilt was made, in Charleston, by Maria Boyd Schulz, the daughter of John Christopher Schulz and Susan Flud Cantey. Maria's sister, Martha Anne (1819-1852) married Dr. Thomas L. Burden, a relative of the donor's husband.  The quilt was donated by Mrs. H. S. Burden in 1970.",
