      "value": "August 19, 1942\nDear Fat Ears,\nI am telephoning you to-night and at\nthat time will give you my ideas on the Government\nsuit. However in order to confirm what we will say\nI will put it in writing now.\nI think it would be a gaod idea for you\nto telephone Charlie Biddle at his house and tell him\nthe situatition, and ask whether he thinks we should\ndelay our suit or at least start it now. In my H\nopinion George Buist will keep putting it off and off\nuntil eventually there will not be any suit. However\nthere is one poiht that may prevent our suing now.\nThat is I am in the Navy and you are in strategic\nservices and no one in the employ of the Government or\nin the armed forces may sue the government. This may\nnecessitate our waiting to sue until the war is over.\nHowever please get in touch with Charlie and get his\nopinion.\nThe men on theplantation can hunt with\nHenry Lowndes if they want to, they do not have to.\nI told them they could and asked Henry to ask them as\nI thought it would give them a good time and keep them\nhappy. However if they are going to prexkdn pretend\nthat this is a chore, why then tell them they can't hunt.\nI mn.so glad you are having Clippy[s ashes\nburied in Grandmothers garden. He loved it so and\nuse to always snuffle among'st the bushes there. I\nknow that will be another place he will walk with us whe\nI return. That week was terrible for you darling and\nI am so sorry that I was not there to help you. I think\nyou were wonderful to have taken care of him and\ncontinued your job and I send you my aemiration.\nWe leave by Navy plane tomorrow morning\nfor San Diego. There we are supposed to embark \nfor Honlulu, but I still doubt it. Do you realize that\nI was detached from duty in Washington the 25rd. of\nJuly and this Saturday will be the twenty third again.\nJust one month with nothing to do, and drawing a salary\nfor it. I have gotten into snch a frame of mind that\nI hate the thought of working. Byt,he way, we have to\nget up every morning on the boat at four oclock and stand\nby the life boats. The idea is early morning is the\nmost dangerous from submarines, and it makes me laugh\nto think of fat face getting up at that hour.\n[End Page 1]\nWe had such a funny time last night. During the dry\nwe had been in town fixing up F1fi's insurance and then\nwe returned to the house and Morris started to show her\nhow to keep books. We had bought ledgers and big\nthirty six column expense books. Fifi is even worse\nthat you about figures but Morris kept plugging ahead\nand I really believe she understands it now. We finally\nwent to bed at twelve and this morning Fifi says she\nbdreamt of numbers all night. She says if she had\na daughter she would make her learn bookkeeping\nand Someth1ng;about stocks and bonds and insurance\nbecause she knew nothing , and on Bobs death did not\neven know how to start. Really if it had not been for\nMorris she wouldhave been in a hell of a mess. Nobody\ndoes anything for one except ones familly I have decided.\nThey all offer advice but no one gets down to the dirty\nwork of actually figuring things out and taking the time\nto see that everything is OK. Please make ymlrself\nlook at figures and learn to balance your check book\nGertie, because if anything should happen to me and to\nMorris there is no one who would really have your\ninterest at heart, and if there were two legal ways to\ndo a thing and one was to there advantage they would\nundoubtly take it.\nWe lunched with Aunt Kate yesterday and\nhad a wonderful Italian lujhch. Spagaetti, cheese, p\nand chops cooked in a wonderful sauce. Aunt Kate is\nmarvellous. Her eyes and mind are just as clear to\nday as they ever where. She is such fun to talk to ,\nbut just cannot seem to take in our children. Fifi\nmakes it much worse by saying that I do not know where\nmy children are as I have not seen them for three years.\nAs a result Aunt Kate does not know what to believe.\nMorris of course laddles out the soft soap and Aunt\nMary who is out here abso6Qtely eats 1t,and Aunt Kate\nsmacks her lips over dt quite a bit.\"Dear Morris'is\nthe only one that know the famllly history, who fs who\nand why,etc. It is dear Moxris who keeps up with all I\nthe nephews and nieces etc. I am telling you that fat\nface has them in the palm of his hand,\nWe are going down now to buy-Fifi an\nadding machine so she can balance her book. She says\nshe may even wear an eye shrde like the real bookkeepers\ndo when they work.\nSweetheart you put to many stamps on you r\nletters. Six cents is all you need. I asked the postman\nto way your last letter and you cculdhave had it weigh\nalmost twice as much for six cents yet you had twelve\ncents on it.\nGoodbye darling, I send you all my\nlove.\n[OVER] Sidney\n[End Page 2]\nafter reading this letter it seems as\nif I am giving a hell of a lot\nof advice. I did not mean to.\nThe ideas just occurred to me\nwhile I was writing. They \nsound like a sermon, when\nall I meant to say \"you don't\nneed as many stampt\"\nlove\nSidney\n[End Page 3]"
