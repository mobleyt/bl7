      "value": "Montruville[?] 25th Septm. 1819\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI first became acquainted with\nyour father at Westminster School about the year\n1767—He was I believe two or three years younger\nthan me, and within about a proportional distance\nbetween our situation in the School, and we boarded at different\nhouses, all that I can recollect of him in this situation\nis that he was respected by his schoolfellows and personally\nstood high in his class. On leaving school I was re-\nmoved to the University of Oxford and he Afterwards\nwent to Cambridge: I of course saw little of him but\nduring the vacation in one of which I entered Cam-\nbridge and [illegible] several pleasant days with time [at?]\nTrinity College, of which he was a Fellow Commoner.\nI found that at College, as at School, he had by his\nenviable disposition, initiated the regard by his\n[illegible] and gentlemen who conduct, commanded the respect\nof his associates. From Cambridge we made together an\n[examining?] through [illegible], Cheshire and during\nwhich he paid particular attention to the great Land which\nthe Duke of Bridgewater was from. completely [illegible]\n\n[End page 1]\n\nappearing to have a predilection for work of such extre-\nmely beneficial tendency. I saw little of him after this \ntour until we again met while studying the Law at the\nTemple, where I’ve collect nothing more than the [illegible]\noccurrences, except that he was one of those who attended the\nMeetings of the Americans resident in Land on convened on the\nsuggestion of Dr. Franklin, Mr. [Curtis?] Lee, Col. Laurius and the mad   \n[cancer?] of the British Government, then full driving America\nto opposition in arms; on at least to action our [potency?]:\nthe [illegible] measures they were [illegible]: I recollect\nthat we had several meetings and I think we [pushed?] the\nBoston Port Bill through both Houses of Parliament and finally\npresented the petition to the King, a copy of which you\nmay have lately seen prohibited here from a Boston\nnewspaper; and his honorable to South Carolina that out of\nthirty, the whole number of Americans then in London who\nhad sufficient [patrician?] to sign there remonstrances,\nsixteen of them were her nature sons: for were this op-\nposition however moderate  [illegible] kept tired for\nseveral who attended in meetings. Your father\ncordially cooperated in these circumstances are\nalso about this time united with several of his young\nCountrymen, who foreseeing the consequences of the in-\njudicious and [illegible] conduct of the Mother Country to her\nColonies, engaged and [servant?] of the Guards to drill us\n\n[End page 2]\n\nour private lodgings, and endeavoured to obtain\nwhat insight we could into the practice of [illegible]\n[illegible].—I arrived in Charleston in December\n1774 and received the Commission of Capt. of Infantry in the\nfirst Rag. of S.G. in June 1775, soon after that period your\nFather arrived and joined me as a Cadet in my company\nbut we were soon again separated, as about October\n1775 the Regiment of Artillery was raised, in which he\nrecurred the Commission of 7th Lieutenant.—Except\nin the attack on this that by the Sen. Peter Parker and [Ln?] Horry\nCharter in 1776; we had little active service in the South\nuntil 1778 when your Father attended Genl. Howe as an\nhis to Camp on the badly planned and miserably executed\nexpedition to St. Mary’s River and Florida; where our\nContinental Regiment were [illegible] by sickness owing to the\nintemperance of the [illegible] and privation of necessary supplies\nat the close of that company your father was with first.\nHave in Savannah when the British attacks it with a\nsuperior force; and the General having in caution by left unguarded\nsome [illegible] in the rear of his right flank, his whole detachment\nwas surrounded, and I [divertedly?] wrote was the consequence: your\nfarther he heard with great intrepidity and himself, but [irregular]\nto maintain order among troops so completely broken in presence\nof more [illegible] enemy. I do not recollect in what [guards?]\n\n[End page 3]\n\nhe served during the [illegible] of Gen R. [Provert?] in 1779 but I\nthink he must have been with General Moultrie [of?] Black Swamp\nand after [illegible] in Charleston when Prevort appeared before and\nsurrounded that City.—Col. Roberts commanding the Artillery having\nbeen killed by a cannon shot when we attacked the British lives[?]\nat Stono your father was promoted to the Liut. Col. of that Regiment.\nHet did not accompany us to the directions siege of\nSavannah in 1779, Within the proceeding year he had full\nopportunity of giving experience in the attack and defense\nof fortified places, [or rather of entrenched Ports, for\nCharleston was no more] when [illegible] Horry Clinton broke\nground before it on the 1st of April, and the town was\ndefended until the 12th of May. I was at Fort Moultrie\nuntil after the British fleet [illegible] it and our Regiment was\nsoon after removed to Charleston but in a few days I was sent\nout by Genl. Lincoln on a special mission, so that I had not one\nopportunity to see much of your fathers conduct there, but in the\nshort time I was in the town, I had a sufficient sample\nof the service to know that his exertions as an Officer\nof Artillery where that Arm was so eminently useful\nand exhorted to such incessant peril must have\nbeen highly meritorious.—In Gen Moultries memoir\nyou will find an incident in your fathers conduct as a prisoner\n\n[End page 4]\n\nof [who?] which terminated in his being restored to the\nservice of his Country: but as I was made a private at\nthe battle of Camden, I can give Gen no farther account\nof his military service. After the War he [illegible]\na member of the Legislature and was for some time\nSpeaker of the House of Representative the duties of\nwhich office he so conducted as to maintain with himself\nthe dignity and decorum of the body in which he provided, and\n[preserved?] under in the debates with impartiality.\nHe practiced Law but a short time at the [Bar?], having\nbeen soon elevated to the Bench of the Court of Common\nPleas: of his [illegible] there and of the useful [illegible] he compiled\nand is unnecessary for me to unite; as Gen might be fully\nacquainted with them.\n\nThe above, my dear Sir, is a doctor of what I can\nrecollection concerning you father, it is the result of a\nmemory never strong and now rendered weaker by old age.\nThe sincere regard I bore to your father prevent me\nfrom answering your application by stating of how little importance\n\n[End page 5]\n\nmy information could be for the purpose for which\nyou desired it: I thought it here to set down what I recol-\nlect as a testimonial of my wishes at least to do [illegible]\nmight be gratifying to his family.\nI beg you to present the appearance of my sincere\ncondolence and high respect to your Mother, and remain\nwith much esteem,\nYour obed. Servant,\nThomas Pinckney\n\n[End page 6]\n\n[To:] Thomas Grimke Esq\nCharleston\n\n[End page 7]"
