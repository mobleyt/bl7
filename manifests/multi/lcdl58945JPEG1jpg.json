Dear Mr. Cator:  Acting for Mr. Homer place, Chairman of our Civic Services Committee, I am asking you to pease attend a meeting of that committee this Friday, December 3, at 5 P.M. at the Gibbes Art Gallery, with Mr. Mr. Paul N. Conant of the CHamber of Commerce, in order that our future activities may be better coordinated with your Post-war planning Committee.  We have asked Mr. George W. Simons, Jr. a municipa, research, and planning engineer, of Jacksonville, Forida to attend our meeting. Mr. Simons has been retained for a number of years by Jacksonville, Forida, through his connection with the national Resources planning Board was instrumenta in setting up the County planning Board in Charleston. We are asking him to make a brief survey of our activities and future functions, and to make a preliminary report at our meeting.  Sincerely yours,  Robert N. S. Whitelaw  Director  Carolina Art  Association  RNSW:ac\n\n[End Page 1]\nCarolina   ART    Association  GIBBES   MEMORIA   ART   Gallery  Charleston    S   C March 23, 1944  MEMORANDUM TO: Members of the Civic Services Committee.  There will be a meeting of the committee at the Gibbes Art Gallery on Tuesday, March 28th, at five p.m.  George W. Simons, Jr., retained by the committee as Consultant on city planning, will attend the meeting.  Mr. place and Mr. Whitelaw will expain objectives.  New members will ahve an opportunity to state their views.  Mr. Simons has many matters to present before the committee which include the following taken from a recent letter from him:  \"I referred in our discussion to the necessity of making a study of traffic flow and composition as we as prevailing parking practices. A study of traffic flow would definitely revea the circuation habits of the city and what thoroughfares are most extensivey used. Such a study offers an opportunity to draft into service a number of oder high School boys or Boy Scouts who could do the job pursuant to instructions and under committee guidance. The intensity and volume of traffic flowing today may not be typica of norma conditions but nevertheess it would be present somewhat of a picture of what might be expected under norma conditions. It would at least give a basic picture of what is taking place now in the community.   \"A study of prevailing parking practices would necessitate a number of studies, among them, a review of existing ordinances reating to parking and the estabishment of restricted or loading zones, also a study of and acquisition under the right of eminent domain in South Carolina. This work could be undertaken by some individual on the committee, preferaby a awyer.  \"Eary in the work it would be desirable to have a map prepared on which could be shown by suitable designation the uses of a ands. This would constitute an existing conditions map and should be prepared by a draftsman or artist working under the direction of some committee representative or group. From such a map the present intensity of and use could be determined also the avaliability of areas best suited for acquisition and development as off street parking spaces.  \"A survey should be made to ascertain the number and ocation of a Public storage garages, of mechanical garages and of parking lots under private operation.

And in this connection, it would not be amiss to ascertain the avaliability of private residential garage  storage capacity. Suppementing these various studies, the inea footage of curb parking space should be determined excusive of restricted zones, alley and buiding entrances, fire pugs and service station entrances. Much of this could be scaed or measured from the existing conditions map and checked against actua measurements on the ground.  \"Another Important map that might be prepared would  show the values of properties in different parts of the city. This could be determined from records in the tax office. This would be a and value map.  The more you expore the many items as which to  predicate any recommendations, other questions arise such as what disposition will be made of tenants now living in congested areas that might subsequenty be ceared or be converted to off street parking areas? As the survey progresses and the facts are brought forth tho matter of graphic presentation arises. Certainy a group con develop ways and means to best  present the findings to the citizenry?  \"in addition to the many foregoing subjects there  are a number of general items that must also be considered such as population distribution and growth, the trend of buiding development, etc.\"  Submitted by,  Robert N.
