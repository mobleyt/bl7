      "value": "Cheraw 13 June 1866 R Revd Mr. Lynch Dear Brother, Since my writing you, I have been at Columbia where I went with sister Anna, and since returning home, two letters have been received from her, showing almost a forgetfulness of her late sickness as now she is able to walk about the house. Sister Ellen (M Baptiste) was quite well and as usual cheerful & the beautiful place is grand with the adornment of spring and now looks charmingly. Dr. Merriwether with his sun-browned countenance, farmer like, has a promising prospcet in his fields. The visit to me was a most pleasant one. Since plowing lands on my place, the River has not overflowed them, though it has been partly full at times. Now my stand of cotton is good, and prospect promises well for a fair crop, and corn is doing very well. Yet I hope you will find it convenient to aid me some further, which I am sure you will cheerfully do if you can. Father is becoming anxious about you. Do write. Both himself and Mother are enjoying their[End Page 1] usual good health DG. A blessing extended to us all. Kind remembrances to our relations. Henrietta, the children, Mrs. Blain & Daughter unite in love to you and begging your prayers. Ever your affec. [affectionate] Bro. F. Lynch [In left hand margin in longhand] 1866 B. Lynch Cheraw June 13th[End Page 2]"
