      "value": "7 January 1852    Between  N. Heyward  J. B Heyward  and  WH Heyward    Agreement [End Page 1] Memorandum of an agreement, made this Seventh day of January, one thousand eight hundred and fifty two, between Nathaniel Heyward, James B. Heyward, and William Henry Heyward. Having agreed with Daniel Heyward Hamilton, for the purchase of \"Fife\" and the negroes, and, also, forty negroes of the Trust estate of Mrs. Hamilton, and taken a conveyance of \"Fife\" and Eighty negroes, in our joint names, and paid Thirty thousand Dollars, and given our Bonds for Eighty six thousand Dollars, being the purchase money of the property conveyed. It is understood and agreed that as soon as a title can be made to Mrs. Hamilton's negroes we will unite in bonds for the purchase money, say, Eighteen thousand Dollars, and take a Bill of Sale jointly. And that we are jointly and equally interested in the purchase: That the plantation shall be managed for the common benefit, and each of the parties be responsible for an equal share of the common loss. To this end the accounts of \"Fife\" shall be kept by the Merchant or Factor, as a separate account; and the income shall be applied exclusively to the expenses of the plantation and the payment of the interest and principal of the purchase money as the several days of payment occur: nor shall any part of the income be appropriated to any other use except such part as may remain after the discharge of the annual expenses and payments charged on the property: And such surplus shall be equally distributed. And in case of a deficiency of income to meet the annual payments, the parties shall contribute their equal parts [End Page 2] to supply such deficiency. And in all questions respecting the management or disposal of the property the voice of two of the parties shall prevail. And this connexion shall not be dissolved by the mere demise of any one of the parties, but his Executor or Administrator shall represent the deceased partner in the control and management of the property. And when the purchase money of the said property is fully paid off-the estate shall be divided or managed on joint account as the parties may then agree  Nathl Heyward  Jas. B. Heyward  Wm. Henry Heyward.  Witness,  William S. Davidson.  Lawrence C. Gordon. [End Page 3]"
