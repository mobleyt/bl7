      "value": "mailed 4 26 43\nRecvd 5 3 43\n24\nEaster Evening the 25th.\nSidney Darling,\nIt is now seven P.M. and I have just finished washing the dishes\nwith Melle. and Miss Evans. We have had supper with the dining room doors wide\nopen looking out at our little plot of grass and daffodils. A lovely spring eve-\nning! and a lovely Easter day.\nLandine and I went ot church as I told you in my letter this morning\n-Tom could not find a taxi any where so he did not turn up. The service was short\nas there was communion after[,]so Landine and I left right after the sermon and we\nwent and called on Aunt Mary who wanted very much to see Landine. Aunt Mary looks\nvery well but complains a great deal about her poor health. Her garden was a mass\nof apple blossoms and tulips[,]and was so pretty.\nTom Evans met us at my house and we took all the easter eggs over\nto Helens[,]and got there for lunch with about t[e]n other people. Serge Obelinsky[in\nthe parachute troops], some people called Fisher I did not know, Avie, the Lester\nArmours, and Lowmans. Af[t]er lunch we hid ten pounds of peanuts for the children-\nThe McKim tribe, Sonia Dill[,] and Legendres. The babys hunted for the eggs and the\nolder kids for the peanuts. They [h]ad a lovely time, and it was like a three ring\ncircus. The men did gardening at one end of the garden, planting vegetables and\nwatering. The dogs chased cats about and the children hunted around the panzies and\nviolets for peanuts. It was great fun, and everyone went home with candy and easter\nbunnies and full of ice cream and cake in their tummies. The only part I missed was\nexercise. I did not get any exercise to-day which I must say is what I always want\nmost on Sunday. Unfortunately there was no time.\nTom Evans took the train back to Philla. this evening, and I am\nhere at my desk writing to you. Bo has gone to bed and Landine is trying to do some\nhome work on arithmatic which seems to be a great trial to her.\nLandine goes back to Middleburg by buss to-morrow afternoon. I\nmust say I have never seen her looking better. She really looks the picture of heal[h]\nthis time. She is getting awfully big, and I think will be tall. She has been havin[g]\nriding lessons right along, and is learning to jump too. She is going to ride in\nthe Foxcroft horse show in amfew weeks. Miss Charlotte [h]as her over every Wendesday\nnow for lunch, and she is going to have her baptised next week with alot of other\nkids which will be nice of her. She seems anxious to be baptised and I think as\nthere are others doing the same thing- its a good idea. It is going to be in Miss\nCharlotte's house. Miss Charlotte called me up and told me about it and was very a\namusing. She said Landine had told her that perhaps if she was baptised \"the devil\nwould go out of her\". Miss Charlotte afreed that perhaps it might.\nI think that you are right about sending both Bo and Landine to\nFoxcroft next year if I do go away-[God knows if I will ever get away].I do think\nMiss Charlotte understands children so well and ismsuch a good influence that you\ncant beat it no matter what Landine wants. I believe if Miss LCHarlotte will have\nthem that is the best salution. I shall plan on that. New York would probably be\nunwise and less of a benifit in the long run. That Hill school is excellent and\nshe is stufdying ever so much better than she ever has before.\n[She has chosen Tom Eastman as god-father- which amused me to death [and] I can't\nwait to write [and] tell him- Aunt Katherine she has chosen as god-mother with\nMiss Charlotte of course as the other one.]\n[End Page 1]\n2\nWell darling I wish I was with you this evening and could find out\nhow you are, how your back feels etc. I would like so much to be with you. I wonder\nwhen that day will come. I long for your news but I have not called you up on the\ntelephone as I know you dont like it[,] and it is sort of hard to talk and ask what\none wants to ask, but I always get such a thrill to hear your voice that it seems\nto me worth it.\nI am hoping to get a l tter to-morrow telling me all about your \nnew office and your self. I do hope the postman will not dissappoint me.\nIt would be so marvelous if you could walk into this room this\nevening and sitbeside me on the sofa. Your flowers are all around the room, tulips,\nsnapdragons and irises.They are so heavenly and everything is attractive and cosy\nof should be-,it is n't,because you are not here to make it it so. When I sit by\nmyself in the living I always go straight to the typewriter and write you as I can \nnot sit by myself and just think and relax. Its too lonely[,] so I must write to you\nand talk to you[,] and tell you how much I love you[,]and miss you sweet ears.It makes\nyou seem so much closer to [me]\nI am in the midst of writing for reservations for the summer for\nthe children. The Narragansett Inn has quoted such high prices -I am writing to\nother Inns and also the Narragansett to find out what sort of reservation one can\nmake. A beach is the answer to children's summer I think[,] and Rhode Island\ncertainly agreed with Bo last summer. She has nto had one cold all winer insp[i]te\nof the flue and awful colds that have been r[a]ging around Washington. Ofcourse\nMiss Evans is amazing at keeping Bo in the pink[,]and she has her alredy shininer her\nsandles and doing things for herself. We are so lucky in having Miss Evans. I assue\nyou she is a dream.\nI sent Rose to New York over Easter to [be] with Sherin but I think\nsh[e] will be back to-morrow.\nI wish I had some interesting news for you[,]but I am afraid I\nhave not. The war news looks tough and hard and slow,although everyone feels we\nare atleast on the road to victory in the Atlantic inspite of the submarines.\nTo-morrow starts an other week- the last of April and soon May\nwill be upon us, and then the heat of a Washington summer- and so it goes. I would\ngive alot to see a field,ora beach, or a mountain, but I guess I will live in the\ninside of Q bldg. for many a moon.\nI was amused yesterday when a delegation appeared in my office\nto ask Madame Legendre whether the french written on the page was idiomatic and\nand correct. I read it over and said I did not understand what \"crampan\" was. They\nnearly died as they thought I was french, and had come to me for the correct\ntranslation I had a good laugh and spent most of the rest of the afternoon going\nwith them from office to,office trying to find the correct word for some technical\nrailroad equipment which noon seemed to be able to solve. We had Larousse diction[ary]\nbut that was not what they wanted.They wanted to french idium[,]not just dictionary\nstuff that might not be the way the ordinary man could understand it. Well it turnd\nout all the french everyone spoke was about my speed and no better[,]and we never did\nget to a conclusion. I had quite alot of fun over it, and thought it was amusingt-\nthat they believed I was pure french and would solve their trouble.\nI laughed over the sencor asking \"what was behind your wife\nsending you flowers\"?- the significance of it? Dont they gatherits because I love\nyou very much darling- thats why. Its pretty amusing is n't it?\nIt is now eight-thirty and Landine is about to go to bed so I\nshall also.We sleep in the same room as I might just as wll.\nAll love to you,my darling- always your- Gertrude\n[End Page 2]"
