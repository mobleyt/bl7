      "value": "34\nThankgiving Day\nDear Sidney,\nIts a beautiful day and I am the skeliton force holding down the office wh[i]le the girls\ntakea day off.\nI wonder how life in Hawaii is today? Are you eating a roast turkey sandwich or are you\ngoing to cook a turkey dinner in your apartment.? Do let me know all about it.\nI was asked to lunch today to meet a Mrs Folger whom you and Morris made a terrific hit\nwith in Clifornia just before you sailed. According to Mrs. Hooker she thinks you two wonderful and\nhas not stopped talking about meeting you . I am sorry I was unable to go but I had promised the\nHydes to lunch with them to-day and eat turkey with them.\nAn other freind of your Freddy Earksner [spelling!] you know the boy in Germany -we met\nhim in Paris. Bright fellow. Well he is in the building to-day and is comming in to see me later on.\nA boy in the Navy by the name of Joe Pulitzer is going to Hawaii the end of the week and I am going\nto meet him and give him a letter to bring. I think I shall call you on the phone this week end and\nhear your news. I feel so out of touch and so far away and so sunk. However lets hope things pick\nup and we meet soon again.\nTalking of people we know. Evvie confessed to me she was a child of 13 in Antibes the \nyear we all were riding around on surf boards and that Morris was her Hero. She was mad about [him] but\nofcourse never spoke to him only watched him from the side lines play tennis and ride the surf board.\nI am sure that bit of Hero Worship will appeal to the Old Mans soul to-day. I guess she was not the\nonly poor gal smitten that way. You two can still break hearts in 1942 according to Mrs Folger, and\nbelieve me know one can appreciate the fact more,or prescribe to it more thoroughly.than I. you 2 are to[ps,but]\nPlease keep your heart for me.... as I need it more than I can say, and nothing will ever be the same\n[t]ill you get home.\nWell the Plantation news is bad.Fires have swept through the country to beat hell. Reports [are]\nre that the timber has been badly burned up high[,]and the quail will suffer too. Its too bad as it looks\nas though my expensive weekend trip the 4th will be punk if the bird shooting is up the flew. Thats the\nS.C. life fo[r] you!?\nI wish I knew some news to tell you.- let me see[,]Fordy and Bill and a couple of men who\nare friends of theirs,but here with out a family[f]or thanksgiving dinner[,]are comming for dinner to-night\nto eat turkey with me. \nLandine is comming in from Virginia for the weekend. I regret I could n't get down there\nfor the Thnak[g]iving game-it was such a heavenly day for the country.\nThere seems to be a big fight going on for Tunis and I believe the Germans are going\nto put up alot of resetance. Here's hoping we are equal to it[,]and I believe from all I have heard- we\nare supposed to be.\nI wonder whether your definate plans have materialised yet? Whats cooking? whats new?\nWhat goes on?\nI miss you and this is just an other line to send you all my love and tell you I love\nyou[,]and miss you and wish to God I could hug you and be with you. Its hell.\nAs ever your-\nGertie\n[End Page 1]\n2\nFreddy Erksner was most interesting. Had been interned in Berlin until June of this year. He lost\n25 lbs on lousy food but looks fine now. He is off for London soon. He was most optimistic about\nthe future and predicted the war would be over in late '44. He thinks its the bloodiest most ralisting\ndamn war that has ever been and only complete anihalation will settle it. It was nice of him to drop \nin and he wanted me to send you his best and be remebered to you. We reminissed about our departure\nfrom Paris to Abyssinia and how he was urged to come along. I think he sort of wished he had too.\nMy those days-Abyssinia, Indo China, Amtibes, South West Africa, St Jean de Luz, Freiburg, Trieben,\nPorto Fino, Bonda, Bali, Seal Harbor, Bastaad etc etc. what memories! what fun! what a life! My the\nheaven of that easygoing Mediteranian life of '29 ! The care free happiness of it all. Will you ever\nforget our entrance into Antibes on our return in the taxi from Marseilles- with the Abyssinian parasol\nand our delight at arriving at Villa les Cedres. ?\nWell I must stop thinking about the passed and m[ail this-]\nG-\n[End Page 2]"
