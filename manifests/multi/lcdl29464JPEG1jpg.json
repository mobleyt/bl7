Miss Jacobs Miss Goldberg. Miss Oberman.   Brother J. Goldman informed us that the local Z.O.A. has a membership of 70, which 64 are paid ups, and 6 unpaid. Report was also given by brother J. Goldman on J.N.F. collections. Purim 20.50 Flaggs 1.20 Boxes 117.43 total 149.13 same was remitted.   Brother Goldman also informed us about the Pittsburgh convention which is to take place on June 29 thru July 2nd, a motion was made by brother Ellison and seconded by brother Gold. to set up a board of 5 to choose and appoint the proper delegate to said convention.   Mr. Ginsberg commended the Chairman of our local membership drive and moved of appreciation for his good work which was unanimously approved and accepted. Our good ch. Alec Ellison promised us that the good work will continue unabated and to a far greater success.   The Chair than [sic] informed us the purpose of the meeting was to hear from Macy Kronsberg who was our only official delegate to the Seaboard Zionist Regional Conference which was held at Norfolk Va. on May 18 thru 20 and that his brother was kind enough to attend at his own expense, and more so his charming wife who was also kind enough to attend and contribute her efforts in behalf of Zion is indeed something that our organization should be proud of.   Brother Macy Kronsberg our only delegate gave us a very vivid and inspirational account of what took place at the conference, his report was so impresive [sic] and picturesque, that brother Ellison moved that Mr Kronsberg should make this report on the second day of SHEVUATH at the Brith Shalom Synagogue, same was unanimously approved and accepted. Brother Kronsberg concluded with a plea that our local Z.O.A. should get everybody in our community interested in Zion, and only American Jewry is the real and only hope for our brethren who are stricken over seas, we here are fortunate to enjoy at least at present the things which they are denied, we are the only remnant of our flock who can do soemthing for Eretz Israel.   No Further business the meeting adjourned with the singing of the Hatikvah,  Respectfully submitted  M.K.  Recording Sect'y"
