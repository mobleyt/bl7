Nov 8th 1863 [In Upper Right Hand Margin] I expect you tomorrow morning Monday morning Nov 9th My dearest Brother, This day, thirteen years ago you officiated at my religious profession. Do you remember in Bank Street & how you mistook Sister Charles who was shedding tears for me & consequently broke down in your sermon? Every year adds to my debt of gratitude for my vocation & to my esteem for it. If I were only worthy of it. Well, you must pray for me that I may be. What a grand time out you have had in Charleston. How superb. No wonder you could not come to Columbia when you had such [In Left Hand Margin in longhand] you. I'm afraid she has no religious vocation. I'm sorry--if not. Pray for us all especially for Sr Gertrude who is very proud of her picture & for your own sister Ellen. Sr Baptista [In Right Hand Margin in longhand] Madame Lynch [End Page 1] grand doings down there with president Davis! How did you like him? My experience is that great people always diminish in proportion as I approach to them--the lens of my imagination no doubt being a much greater magnifier than that of my reason. Did I ever tell you that I once wrote to Mr. Jeff Davis & he answered me very amiably & cordially? I did then. You must come & tell us all about your time out. Our school has about 120 scholars counting externs--among whom Miss Singleton, Miss Freymont, Miss Taylor, Miss Seibles & Beauregard nice, little Proctor. We expect as a boarder Miss Douglas of Va., daughter of Senator D-- who I am told is one of the cleverest men of our time. She wishes to become a Catholic. Let me tell you [End Page 2] something good. We have been trying to get a good cow, having disposed of one that was no account. Mr. Kenney who is very kind, attended to the matter for us. He & Sister Frances are great friends. We saw an advertisement of a splendid cow, warranted to give 20 qts [quarts] per dime & wrote immediately to Mr. W.M. Rivers of Winnesboro S.C. to purchase it of him. Many others wrote at the same time & equally anxious, but he wrote to John that he supposed he was a Brother of Bishop Lynch whom he had the pleasure of knowing well & therefore he gave him the preference. So we are indebted to you for the cow & we got her, but I think also we are indebted to the prayers of the Sisters, who were very earnest in them. Mr. Rivers warrants[End Page 3] the cow to give 20 quarts a day & says, with good feeling she will, he thinks give 30. She is $600 delivered in Winnesboro. We should pay $1000 here for one much inferior. Just think I have yielded to the entreaties of Mr. Lapten or rather Mr. Cory & allowed the photographist [sic]--Mr Durber, to come & take Sister Ursula's picture! At the same time he took Sister Etienne's for her Father as long ago requested & others. I read a long letter from Poor Mrs. Monroe which I will show you. I wish you would write to her. She wishes you to visit Anderson where there are a few Catholics. Enclosed was a letter from Abb [Abby] Pinckney, who sends love to you & us. She intends settling his affairs & consecrating herself to God & religion. Miss Jones talks of writing to you. [Rest of Letter cut off][End Page 4]"
