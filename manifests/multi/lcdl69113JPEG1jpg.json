      "value": "To Mrs Sidney J. Legendre,\nO.S.S. Detachment,\nA.PO 887\nPostmaster, New York.\nFrom\nLt. S. Legendre, USNR\nPO Box 166, Commandant\nNavy No. 128\nFL PO San Francisco.\nDecember 4, 1943\n68\nGertie Darling,\nNo news from you yet certainly hope I will receive a letter\nsoon. I arranged a dance for the enlisted men of our activity. It took\nplace this evening and I am afraid was a fizzle. I just left it and there\nwere not sufficent girls for the number of men. You know the shotrage of\ngirls out here is rather acute anyway, but we thought that all the sailors\ncould round them up. They all had girls when they were ready to leave in\nthe afternoon. At least the girls were to meet them at the YMCA. However\nour boys arrived just a minute after the busses sent out by the army camp\nfor girls. It seems the army bous strong armed the navy girls into their\ndance. I was terribly sorry because they had been looking forward to the\nparty for a long time and things should have run off very smoothly as they\nall worked very hard trying to arrange everything. It was at an a tractive\nplace , the wailai club. You will remember that we danced there years ago\nunder the moonlight. Since that time it has burned down but a roofed shelter\nhas been constructed right on the shore. It is rather attractive with its\nsloping roof and hawaiian style of architecture. Of course the faint moon\nlight from a thin sliver of a new moon, the sound of the surf on the reef\nand the smell of ginger in the air all aided the setting. I only stayed a\nminute but in that time my mind raced back to the days when you and I use\nto be here together, when we danced at Wailai, played tennis and swam in the\nblue water. On the way home I stopped on the bluff and looked down on the\nsea. The surf white in the half light, the reast of the s ea a deep indigo\nblue black. A soft breeze swept across my face and I could almost smell\nyour perfume and feel you next to me. Could almost touch your hand and hear\nyou laugh. How long that has been and how long it seems it will be before\nwe meet again. The war creaks on island to island with a bushful of them\nyet to come , I suppose.\nIsn't it interesting to see what is going on in old Iran. Just\nto think that we were there only a few days a gon, that we know Teheran, and\nT. biz, the terrible roads, the dirt and filth of the citires. I bet old\nChurchill and Roosevelt will never stay in some of those terrible place\nalong the border that we did. Do you remember the last night we spent in\nIran at that terrible little inn. How we slept on those boards and in the\nmorning came down hoping we could hace some kind of breakfast after facing\nthe primitive washing conditions. All we were given was a kind of tea that\nwas undrinkable. Then that wonderful train in Irak. That breakfast you had\nat the station, with eggs and bacon. Hot coffe and marmalade. What fun that\ntrain trip was up to Baghdad, and how wonderful the Maude hotel seemed. I \nremember walking around and touching everything, the hot water in the tub\nwas heaven and sitting at the table and eating what was proably very bad\nfood, was then wonderful. Goodbye darling."
