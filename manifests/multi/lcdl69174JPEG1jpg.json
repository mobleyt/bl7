      "value": "Letter 13\nMrs Gertrude Legendre,\n1st. Lt WAC\nUS Prisoner of War in Germany\nc International Committe of the Red Cross January 1, 1945\nGeneva, Switzerland.\nGertie Darling,\nThe first day of the new year and I feel that it\nis a year full of happiness and promise. I feel that you\nwill be released soon and will be back in the states. Why\nI should feel this is quite be ond me as I have he rd nothing\nabout you at all. It may be a premonition or just because\nI want it to happen so much.\nThe New York Office forwarded me copies of letters\nreceived from Janie and her husband. I could not believe my\neyes as I read about the polo, he is president of the club.\nThe long discussion of the relative merits of the ponies, the\ndinners and who they had seen. How impossible it was to\nremember anyones name because one saw so many people. A\nshort sentence saying that no doubt the poor people are having\na difficult time buying food and then a paragraph about you.\nI kept beth of these letters because I think they will give\nyou a great kick and also they should become part of history.\nI wonder if the writers or the recipients wondered at\nthemselves and considered what they were saying and doing\nwhile the entire world was a w r and men were dying, loosing\ntheir limbs and eyes.\nChauncey Parker came to dinner last night and we\nreally kidded him about his farm in Virginia. He will not\nadmit that it looses money. Appare tly it is one of those a\namazing farms that always break even year in and out. In\nother words it looses plenty. His wife told me when I was in\nWasington that it always had lost but now they had a new\nmanager and expected it to make money. Does this raise old\nmemories, stories of what manager[s]would do for one. Do you\nremember the one at Boone Hall. He was going to set the\nworld on fire. I heard while I was in the South that not\nonly had he practically ruined the owners but had threatened\nto sue them and had to be bought off. Apparently he had\nlost the sight of one eye. The tractor had run over him\nor a still had exploded. Whatever it was he claimed it was\ndue to the owners negligence. No[w]reliable authority tells\nme that the original owners are trying to buy it back. Have\nyou ever heard of anyting so wacky in your life. I am\ncertain Mo ris is quite right when he says that everyone is\na little bit crazy on some subject. That place has absorbed\nmore fortunes and its soil has proven a burial ground for\nenough money to pay off the national debt. Probably the only\nperson benefiting from all these deals are the real estate\ndealers. However even they do not do so well[,] because the\npurchasers and sellers for some re son expect them to do\neveryting from the laundry up. I really think that someone\n[End Page 1]\nplaced a curse on the land. Probably one of those haunts\nthat can only be released if you look at the moon through\ncorn liker with a rattlesnake between your teeth.\nReceived a letter from Armant saying that he had\nheard from Olive what a wonderful time we had had in New\nOrleans and how he wished he had been with us. When we had seen\nhim last he had said that he would be in New Orleans when we\narrived there. Just joking we said that would arrive long\nbefore he did. The fact that we did has practically broken\nhis heart. I hope we may see him within the next month.\nHe is now in charge of a fourteen thousand ton ship, which\nis some raise from the days of the Bo Peep and eggs ala Mornay\nBo Peep. Received a letter from a lady asking if we would\nsell our little sail boat. I am going to write her that it\nis for sale at the same price we paid because I doubt that we\nwould use it for years. This Jap war will probably go on\nfor another two years and you will be too busy to go up there.\nWe may not ever want to go there again, and as this seems to\nbe a sellers market I believe it is a good time to let it go.\nI think this discussion of the reason to sell is very funny\nbecause even if you do receive this letter you probably will\nnot be able to answer it for months. In fact I cannot\nunderstand why you are not permitted to write. It would help\nso much to know that you are alive and well, and I cannot\npossibly hee how this information could effect anyone but you\nand me.\nBo and Landine sent me christmas cards and Miss\nEvans wrote a letter saying that Polly had invited them to\nChristmas dinner. She is such a really good friend of yours,\nand so kind hearted. Of all the people you have known, familly\nand all she is the one who has done the most for the children,\nsponsored them and telphoned to find out if they were alright\nand needed anything. I wrote youhow kind she was to me\nin New York and sent me two bottles of champagne on my\nbirthday so that I was able to celebrate in great style with\nthe children and Morris.\nCharlie Harding is comming for dinner on Friday.\nYou may remember that he went with us on that funny fishing\ntrip with Ruth and Ogden. The one where we all has a poison rash\nand I was so hungry all the time that I could think of nothing\nbut chocolate cream pie. I just spoke to him for a moment so\ncan not give you any gossip or information on the state of\nthe world. However I may have something of interest by my\nnext letter.\nGoodbye darling, I do hope you are well, and that\nI will hear from you soon. With all my love.\nSidney Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
