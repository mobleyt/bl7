      "value": "January 11.\nDear Gertie,\nPlease overlook the choice paper but I can find no other. I started\na letter to you a week ago [in New Orleans] to have it interrupted by a call by a buddy from\nSan Antonio who was motoring to Florida, when I resurrected the letter later\non it sounded so stale I thought I'd wait until a billet-doux could be redolent\n[hows that toots?] with sage brush and the plains of Texas or what have you.\nJimmy, Essie and I arrived here intact two days ago and it is freezing and I \nam disgusted. Jimmys nose is redder than a drunkards and Essie is almost \nwhite and teeth chattering constantly, if my father were feeling better.I'd \nrun right back to warm old New Orleans but I'm here for two weeks at least. \nGertie I am crazy about the dorine you sent me, it is perfectly \nstunning and we are never separated, thank you a lot. Jimmy loves his blocks\nfrom Landine so much he brought them all over here with him and I left the\nDolly Sisters in raptures over their gifts from Landine. They fancied them-\nselves artistes with the paint set and concocted the most grotesque portraits \nof pere Legendre, square face, perch eyes and granite chin, it is too mar-\nvelous. Kafrum is going to have a \"one gal show\" and we will have a field \nday when she does another \"still life\" or two of Armant. You, Sidney and \nMorris must come over, lets set [the arrival] for Washingtons Birthday. I have ordered \na very handsome present for you and Sidney, in fact wrote away early in \nDecember for it and shall forward it on when it appears. It is called \n\"dancin Dan\" and is a black wooden negro who dances divinely with a few \npoundings on a little board. I hope you haven't already seen a \"dancin Dan\" \nfor it took us by storm and you can entertain your Medway guests by the hour. \nI assure you its \"somon.\" It takes a little practice to make Dan keep time  \nto jazz on the radio but its well worth the dedication of one half hour so\nthis noble effort. Hold everything until you see this paragon!\nWe fe[a]sted on the marvellous cheese from New York, never have\nI tasted anything so delicious and knowing what cheese hounds we are you \n[End Page 1]\n2.  \ncan imagine our orgies around the dining-room table, groaning under its weight\nof cheese and water crass. I hated to leave New Orleans because there was still\na box of brie as big as the moon---my figure, help, help!! I gained four pounds\nas a result and can hardly squeeze into that lovely green evening gown you sent\nme. Its so good looking I am playing tennis furiously now to lose those pounds\nwhich stick out under that stream lined dress so prominently. I love the dress\nso I refuse to stop wearing it and my father is so delighted to see me in bright\ncolors again he vows he feels much better. See all the delight you are spread-\ning IF I can just keep thin!\nMy brother Howard, who is a Lieut. in the Air Corps has been ordered to\nBarksdale Field, near Shreveport. We are trying to keep him here at Kelly Field\nand you should see me firing wires and letters at the two Texas Senators signed\nby my father telling them to get the orders rescinded. Its a picnic and I'm\nhaving more fun than when I used to write them Huey Long was a louse. Howard\nhas found there is good polo at the field at Shreveport with a civilian team\nto \"give battle\" with the army team and isn't particularly perturbed at the idea\nof leaving if the Senators don't change the orders. If he goes he must leave\nhere in a week and trailing his car will be a horse van or whatever its called\nreplete with three ponies, it should be quite a sight. I hope those demure\nlittle ranch ponies like the grass near Shreveport, it seems to be his only\nconcern. He has just given his best girl his pet mare IN FOAL! How if that\nisn't ROMANCE what is. Knowing his frugal instincts I enquired further and\ndiscovered said mare was very lame so I don't know just how to index this beau\ngeste to his lady fair. \nWe had a very quiet Christmas. Legume was really ailing with antrim\ntrouble which is somewhere near the sinus and had to have it punched twice, to\nhis great discomfort. I really believe his glasses need adjusted, or he should\nat least wear his glasses and when he sees his oculist all should be well. He\nfelt rotten and still does and I did my best to make him dash over to Palm Beach,\ndescend upon you and Papa John and get some good hot sun. Or at least come over\nhere where the air is dryer. This place is wonderful for head troubles [sounds\n[End Page 2]\n3.\nlike a mental hazard but it isn't that].Anyway he wouldn't listen to me. I\nleft Mimi and Kafrum at home and that fact alone may force him to sunnier\nclimes! \nMy wonderful Popeye is again a FATHER. All these puppies are blonde\ntoo, in four litters every single puppy has been a pale cream, how do you ac-\ncount for that, his superior will power? I miss him very much and should\nhave brought him with me but thought Jimmy enough for this outing.\nThank you again Gertie for that lovely vanity and gifts to our vast\nlitter of children. By the way Landine wrote them a dashing letter, don't\ntell me that babe of a few years can WRITE by now! Surely the nurse must\nhave printed it or held her hand, if she wrote it I hang my head in shame\nfor mine are so dumb I can scarcely read their writing now. Armant will\ncringe before Sidney in shame. Lots of love to you goophers and please\ncome over to New Orleans before you get too far from Palm Beach or Medway.\nI'm afraid you'll go off on some long trip before I see you both and Moon\nFace.\nDevotedly,\nOlive\n[End Page 3]"
