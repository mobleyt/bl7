      "value": "Rock Hill October 16th 1849 Dear Mamma, I come at last to break the spell that seems to have bound me, in letter writing. In some way or other much time has elapsed since I last wrote you and Sarah--Do say to Sarah, that this has been quite unintentional--I have wished & intended to write her, but Ellen wrote home days ago and I thought that would probably explain the matter--and her letter moreover would serve for a little while, in place of one for me. And now that the time is near [bye?] for us to leave, I find so much to do, that this is my excuse. Thank Sarah for her very welcome letter, received a few days ago. It was delightful to me to hear from you all, and to know how Papa had got. I had felt very uneasy about his state of health, and was anxious to hear again. I am truly glad to hear that he is well enough to travel, but regret the necessity to leave you all. And from what Sarah tells me of your plans, that you have sold Hopeton, I hope Papa will be settled to his satisfaction soon. And leave no accession for his being alone. I hope you have heard from him at the time you expected. But so you know, I feel a sort of regret at your giving up Orangeburg, and for this reason, that you will go further[End Page 1] from us. This excepted, I hope you will be pleasantly located at [Sumter?] and enjoy many pleasant times. Dear Mamma, I am glad to hear that you [& Sarah?] are going to Charleston the latter end of this month--It will add greatly to my happiness in arriving at Charleston. Do you feel no apprehensions about the [illegible]? Sarah speaks in her letter of having no news to write about & thereby make a little interesting, but induce a letter from her and any of you at home over not her need to make it interesting to me--& I am afraid you will have the complaint to make of me, for now as the time draws near to see you all, I do not feel disposed to talk of any thing else. But to think only & speak of the Happy Home to which I am returning--I sometimes think how desirable it is that Christians should feel just so in regard to Heaven. To think often of that Happy Land,\" where from Sin or Sorrow free,\" we shall dwell with God Alone.\" So think often of this, seems to loosen our affections from earth, and lift our desires after Heaven. And now that the summer is ended and I review the past--I see nothing but blessings and mercies! And oh what a responsibility rests upon us! Indeed Mamma, the season has been a delightful one--every thing has contributed to make it pleasant--& I trust & hope in some degree profitable. The health in our family has been almost uninterrupted--abundance has been given us--of every kind[End Page 2] necessary to comfort--indeed every temporal blessing has been bestowed--then the delightful discourse with Christian friends--the Church privileges, & delightful communication with you all through letters. (A large portion of which I have to thank Sarah for) I must say, has been pleasant this summer. I often think what cause I have to be here in the efficacy of prayer. May my Faith be increased, and I receive more of the Spirit of Prayer. I suppose Ellen mentioned that our friends Mr. Reed & Miss [Blucker?] had left us. Indeed I suppose told Sarah all our news--of our two very pleasant Choir meetings when we had moonlight, and of all other such matters. On Saturday last Dr. & [Meares?], Mr. & Mrs. Seabrook dined with us. the Rev. M. Pinckney came in the afternoon & just before they left us near dark--We had some sweet music from Dr. & Mrs. [Meares?]. He has an exquisite voice. He left us for Charleston on Monday. Mr & Mrs. Frank Johnston came up about a week ago for their health - both of them completely broken down - he from fever & she from deblility. The are staying at Mr. Andrew & have got better. She & Mrs. Andrew, called here yesterday morning, but I was unfortunately from home. We (Miss Maria Pinckney & myself) had left here at an early hour ten oclock, to pay a distant visit Mrs Davis who lives 6 miles from here. We made the visit, were warmly received & kindly treated, and[End Page 3] on returning -- we stopped at Henderson for Miss Maria to do some shopping - we reached home a little before three. And then, (at least I did, a very pleasant morning although by being from home, I lost the pleasure of seeing the ladies. I want to have two more dinings before we leave. The Johnstons -- to have them is one occasion & some of the Pinkneys are the other. But the time is getting short & the weather is now raining & if it continues may prevent. But I hope it will clear off by tomorrow. Especially as it is our Bible class day -- we will meet tomorrow at twelve oclock in the morning -- instead of the afternoon as heretofore. I suppose you have heard of poor Elisa Johnston's very low state. She is in consumption & is very low -- in bed -- occasionally is a little better. She is in a happy frame of mind & only disturbed about her poor mother. She will be greatly afflicted to lose Elisa. May she be supported under all her sufferings. I hope I shall see her. Miss Maxwell would go down this week, but for the accounts of the fever. And the last letter on Saturday, said that Elisa had [rebined?] & was a little better. And now dear Mamma it is dark & my paper is out. Please excuse this barren letter, but I hope to see you all soon. Meanwhile, may God protect & bless you all & ourselves prays your affectionate daughter Mary M[End Page 4]"
