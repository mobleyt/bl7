      "value": "Greenville, Oct 12th 1846 My dear Catharine, As I shan't be able to write again before I reach Pendleton, I scrub a few lines to you now, to say that I am just about starting for Caesars Head where I expect to meet the girls from Flat Rock. I have engaged an excellent pack & very good horses, so that even if the weather should be unfavorable we will probably get on quite well. There has been a cold change since Saturday night which made it much pleasanter to get through the duties of yesterday. I preached three times & administered the Lords supper. Mr Arthur read Prayers. Today is not a very bright day, for seeing Caesars Head, but I suppose of course, Mr. Memminger will be there as our agreement was that nothing but positively bad weather was to prevent our meeting there. If he should not be there either today or tomorrow I am to go up to Flat Rock again, & bring the girls down. The change makes the journey much pleasanter as both Friday & Saturday were quite hot, & I was glad that Hetty had not come this side the mountain. You would be [End Page 1] surprised to find such a difference between this & the other side of the Saluda. My appetite which I was complaining of in one of my letters to you as too great, is getting down to its ordinary measure. Indeed I feel somewhat the want of the sulphur water & wish you would get one of the Apothecaries in Town to send for some of the Virginia white sulphur water for me. Haviland used to keep it but you remember, he had none the last summer. I wrote a good many letters on Saturday, among others one to Martha in Beaufort, who I thought would like to hear from me, & who I think deserves all the kindness of her friends for the cheerful & efficient manner in which she is doing her duties. Meta & Hetty give me no trouble at all. They are always in good spirits, and ready for any circumstances that may occur. Every one has been extremely kind to them. I feel quite homesick, which I suppose you are glad to hear. My spirits are always good while travelling but yet I always long to be at home, and if I could only manage not to take so much \"carking care,\" would probably be as well there as elsewhere. [End Page 2] I have written a letter to Sister Betsy early this morning & it is about time for me to set off. God be with you all. Kiss the children for me. Remember me to all friends. If I don't name them specially, it is because they are so many, & I am always in a hurry while writing. Yours dear Catherine W.H. Barnwell P.S. Mr. & Mrs. Lynch who are home, have been inquiring very particularly after your Aunt Mathews & Hetty. I met an old acquaintance, Mrs. John Izzard Middleton, (Miss [illegible]), but I have been so busy in preaching, that I have had time to say very little to any one. She seems pious. W.H.B. [End Page 3] <Greenville C. H. SC OCTOBER 12> 1846 Mrs. W.H. Barnwell Charleston So.Ca. 1846 [End Page 4]"
