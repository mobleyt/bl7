      "value": "IB.\nAug 26.\nDear Sidney,\nI have mailed you today via Navy Department letter NoI\nI am writing you this one also to day via Pearl Harbor Navy Base\nand am anxious to know'wh1ch one gets to Hawaii first. Be sure and let\nme know. I told you in my letter about telephoning me . This can\nbe done easily. It costs II dollars for three minutes not much more\nexpensive than sending a cable. We should do this every couple of\nweeks. The Operator notifies one two hours in advance the call is\ncomming through. If you would rather 1 call you tell me your home\ntelephone nomber so I can call at night. Its cheaper.\nI count the days off thinking about your arrival in\nPearl Harbor. I do hope it was smooth and that you slept on deck.\nI spoke to Miss Charlotte to-night on the telephone and\nshe does not like that School for Landine. She advises living at\nFoxcroft and going to school at Middleburg. She wants Melle. to\nteach French in Hiddleburg so that her wages will be less for me\nwhich is a swell idea, I think it will work well. Miss Charlotte\nwants Landine to be around Foxcroft and have piano lessons thereetc.\nIt would be perfect I think so thats the plan.\nBo and Landine are having a fine time in Watch Hill so\nI shall leave them there as long as possible. Middleburg starts \nschool the end of September.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nMy Job is going fine and I do like it. I walk or bicycle to work\nevery morning and play tennis some times in the afternoon. The w\nweather has turned much cooler and is very pleasant.\nI am going up to Ellen Frazer Saturday night to spend Sunday\nwhich should be fun. The next one I shall go to Kathrines.\nEvery one asks about you and Morris and send you their, best.\nI saw Nick Ludington the other day who said after the war he had\nhis life all planned. California in winter and Maine in Summer.\nThat was the top he thought, and I think thats pretty good dont you3 \nI miss you so much its terrible. M  I hope this war does\nnot last too long. I cant bear it. I think about you so much andwant\nso much to kiss you and tell you how much I love you.\nPlease give my love to Norris. i hope he is feeling alright.\nKnoth writes he is going to South America for the Gov.and\nthat if we want the timber cut on Medway we should let him do it\nin September before he goes. I shall write him we will do nothing\ntill after the war. Is that right?\nRose is,st1ll the cook and is wonderful. I dont know whatI\nwould do with out her. She is wonderful.\nAll my love my sweet ears. Goodnight with a hug and a fat kiss\nmy sweet heart.\nYour-fat-\nGertie.\nCan't wait for a letter from you.\n[End Page 2]"
