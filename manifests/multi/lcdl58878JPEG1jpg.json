He immediatey took over the chair  from Mayor William McG. Morrison, who rwas acting as chairman.  Mr. Kronsberg is president and  founder o Edward\"s, Inc., department store. He has been active in  civic, business and community affairs and organizations for many  years.  it.V\"j a COURKH  WAR WO \"4  CHfMWfttor ega  Test Orders Razing  Of 45 Coming St.  The ways and means committee  of city Council at a meeting last  night awarded C. W. Banchard a  contract to raze the dweing at 45  Coming street, for $600. The house,  owned by Sam Berin, has been condemned, and this is expected to be  a test case. If this action withstands  the ega tests it is expected that  more condemned houses will be torn  down.  A discussion was held on the matter of repacing or atering the marbe tablet in the city Council chamber. The tablet is carved with the  names of the mayors ana is fu.  To repace it would take $3,000. A  man was suggested to erase the  present ettering and to repace the  names in smaer etters, which  would give room for twice as many  mayors. This would cost $1,200. The  tablet, put up in the administration  of Mayor William A. Courtenay, is  believed to contain several errors in  initias, which would be corrected.  No action was taken.  The meeting directed corporation  counse to attempt to obtain a judgment against the owner of 61 Washington street. The city tore down  some condemned porches on this  buiding,    and    has   never   entered  judgment for the cost.   This action  I is  being  taken  to protect the  city  in case of a sae."
