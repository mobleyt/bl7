      "value": "Charleston 22 Sept 1818 My dear Mother, I have just heard that Bythewood sails tomorrow, which I hope he may do, as I have every thing ready for him, and the wind perfectly fair. I hope you will be pleased with your Hat, I have given a high price for it, but I could not get a nice one for less, The Crape which is turned up in front is intended to be worn down, but you can do as you like, your Stockings are very beautiful I think but I am no judge.-I have sent you the same Candles that you had before, I found that they were the best, I dare say when you hear the price of Marys spermacete Candles you will be glad that I bought tallow for you. - I send you the lambris for Edwards Shirts and would be glad if you could send them by the next trip of Bythewood, I think you had better pay for them and let me return you the Money here. - do tell Betsy that she will find all the leaves of her Books ready out, as I took the liberty of reading them before they were sent. I hope she will like the trimming. - tell Sally I have had her Stockings ready a long time, perhaps now she does not want them, as it is probable she has taken off her black dress. - There are plenty of Winter goods come in already, and not at all too soon for it is almost cool enough for Flannel now. -- [End Page 1] I am afraid this weather is very unfavorable for the Cotton planters, - Mr. Garden has had several bales of cotton down already, and sold it at a very high price, he has had a letter from E Gibbes lately saying that she is positively not to be married to Mr. Roberts as was reported. - he is paying his addresses to [lars line?] Smith. Miss [Julia?] Rutledge is bemarried to Capt Morgan of the Navy - direct from General Rutledge I hear. The Children are tolerably well, Nat has a little fever every day. I believe in consequence of a large bile which he has on his forehead, it makes him very fretful. James improves very much. - I am better since the fruit is gone, but still very unwell, I wish I could go into the Country, I think I would soon get well there. I have not seen Mrs. Finley for some time I sent her the Quinces; she requested me to send her love to you and to thank you very much for them ---- I see the Osborne family very seldom indeed, Mrs. Lourdes has been very attentive to me this Summer but I seldom see her. We dine there on Tuesday next. - There is a very delightful preacher in town at present, he preached at the new Church the last Sunday and we are to have him at St Pauls the next. he is an Englishman, and I believe his name is Sims or something like it. I have been disappointed in getting Haywards Sermons, but I hope that I shall have them [End Page 2] ready to go by the next opportunity. - I have sent you a box with two loaves and a half of Sugar I bought one loaf for you at 31 1/2 and if you like it you had better write for more, the rest is for my sweatmeats, beg the girls to cut them for me. - I dare say there is some mistake in the direction of the Boxes we live so far out of town, that I am obliged to give Paul the Cards, and after he gets the Boxes he mails the direction on - do give my love to all my friends and believe me dear Mother to be Your ever Affectionate Child Hetty B Heyward PS There is a Box on board of Bythewood for Betsy and your half barrel Flour. -- $30 in Silver in Betsys Box. - I will return your [Mugo?] by the next trip of Bythewood. [End Page 3] [in pencil:] 1818 Mrs. Mary Barnwell. Beaufort. Capt Bythewood [End Page 4]"
