      "value": "[Page One]\nWashington\n4th April 1848\nMy dear sir,\nUnderstanding from your letter to\nMr. [Burt?], that is was desired to know my opinion,\nwhether it would be [advisable?] for the state to\nbe represented in the Baltimore convention,\nI thought if most respectful to have a [meeting?]\nof our delegation, to ascertain their views\nbefore I undertook to ex[illegible] my opinion.\nAfter full consideration they were of the\nopinion, the state ought not to be [illegible]\nand decidedly with the exception of Mr. [Sims?], who\n[illegible] to differ, but declared he\nwould take no part.  It was, however, decided, \nthat it would be [un?]advisable to make an\naddress to our Constituents, as it might look\nlike dictation. Each was left to write\nand [confess?] his opinion.\nIt is well known that I have been [approved?]\nto a convention to nominate a President\nbecause it is [illegible] by the Constitution,\nand is intended to supercede its [provisions?]\nin reference to his election, as far as the [illegible]\nis concerned. To that extent the [nomination?] is\nin effect the election.  Because it destroys\nthe compromises of the Constitution between\nthe larger and smaller members of the Union,\nas it relates to his election, be [securing?] to the former\nthis preponderance, in the electoral college, and de-\npriving the [latter?] of this in the eventual election\nby the House. Because, as constituted, the\nconvention is an [inaugural?] and [unfair?] repre-\nsentation of the party. Instead of going to [each?]\nstate as representation in the Constitution,\nin proportion to its relative party strength,\nif [giving?] each the relative [weight?] it has\n[Page Two]\nin the electoral college, without the least\nregard to its party strength.  The effect of\nthat is, to give several states in which\nthe democratick party has no weight, which\nhave not a vote in either House of Congress,\nand which can command not a single\nelectoral vote, as much weight as others,\nwhich give a unanimous vote in both \nhouses, and an [illegible] electoral vote\nthe other way.  Now, as the non slave holding\nstates are much more populous that the \nslave holding, while they are far [left?]\ndemocratical, it is apparent that the \neffect of the nominations is, to give a [illegible]\nof the party, and  the least sound [illegible] of the\nUnion in a party [illegible], the control of the \nelection.  The effect of that, again, is to sacri-\nfice the interest of the slave holding state, and\nto expose them, [illegible], to great danger,\nif not certain [destruction?].\nThe first effect is to five a minority of the\nparty in the non slave holding states a control over the Executive Depart-\nment of the government, [illegible], who will be\nelected, if he desires a [reelection?], of the election of a for-\n[illegible] to succeed him, as he always\nwill, one or the other, he [must?], to accom-\nplish his [object?] [illegible] the minority in those\nstates, as they have the control over the\nnomination. To do that he most be-\nstow his patronage freely on it, and accom-\nmodate his [meaures?] to their [illegible]\nto the [illegible] and [illegible] of the interest of the\nmajority of the party  in the other states. But\nstill worse, he becomes for the time the\nleader of the party, and, in order to sustain\n[illegible] against the [illegible] of the opposition,\n[Page Three]\nthe delegates from the states whose interest are thus\nsacrificed are forced by party ties to defend him\nin the very measures, by which they are.  Under\nthis influence, a minority of the party, in the\nnon slave holding states are [absorbing?] and [illegible]\na majority in the slave holding to their [own?]\non the most [illegible] of all questions to us; I \nallude to that, which relates to slavery.  It is\n[owing?] to this cause, that we have not long\nsince united and put down abolition in the \nother states, as we might easily do, if united.\nTo long as it is permitted to operate, there is\n[illegible] redemption for the slave holding states\nthen certain distinction if it is permitted to \ncontinue, will be the end. The process has\nalready commenced and made great progress, \nof which no stronger evidence can be furn-\nished than that they should consent to go\ninto the Convention prepared to be held\nin May next in Baltimore.\nHeretofore they would have met with indigna-\ntion a proposal to meet in Convention [avowed?] and known\nabolitionists.  A single individual of that des-\ncription would have been sufficient to\n[determine?] every delegate from the \nslave holding states from taking a [sect?] in\nthe Convention. But time, with the influences\nof the cause stated, has already effected so great\na change, that all those states, with the excep-\ntion of ours, have already, as is [believed?], ap-\npointed delegates to that Convention, although\nit is well known, that is will consist of nu-\nmerous individuals, as hostile to our democra-\ntick institutions, as Geddings, or any other abo-\nlitionists.  Indeed, there will be very few \ndelegates from the non slave holding states, who\n[Page Four]\nwill not on this all important question be\ndecidedly opposed to us.  Many of them, it is true,\nwill disavow the Wilmot proviso; but they will\nsupport other measures being the same ob-\nject and not [illegible] fatal in there consequences\nto us. To show how little reliance we can\nplace on the delegates from those states on this,\nto [our?] [illegible] question, it is sufficient to state that\nthe legislature of N. [illegible] has just [illegible] our\nact to make it [illegible] in any of its [illegible] to\naid, even the federal officers, in [delivering?] of\nfugitive slaves to their masters.  It was with\nthe [exemption?] of two votes, [illegible] [illegible];\nWhigs, B[illegible] and Hawkes all voting for it.\n[Timber?] acts have been [illegible] by Michigan abd\nother states, on the last [illegible] of their legislature\nby the joint consent of all parties.\nAnd yet, such is the progress which has already been\nmade to [illegible] [initiate?] our feelings with that of the non\nslave holding states, on even this question,\nthat the entire slave holding states with, as\nstated, the exception of ours, have agreed to go\ninto convention to be thus [compared?], to[illegible]\n[illegible] by their joint action and [illegible]\nfor the Presidency. What is this, but, in effect, to\nmerge the abolition question, as far as the Presidency\nis concerned? And what is that, but a declara-\ntion, in effect, that abolition of slavery with\nus, is a [illegible] evil-[illegible] to be dreaded than the de-\nfeat of the party in the presidential [illegible], which now decides the two par-\nties?\nBut it is said, that the [illegible] from the slave\nHolding states go in with a fixed determination\nnot to agree to the [illegible] of any one,\nwho is not decidedly with us on the subject\nof abolition.  Whether they can be bought\nto take [firmly?] such a stand, remains to be\n[Page Five] \nseen.  It is to be found, they will not, that\nthe desire to avoid defeat in the election,\nand to preserve the [ascending?] of the party will\nmake them yield to the majority of delegates\nfrom the non slave holding states. But, be\nthat as it may, it will not avert the danger, \nwhich must result from agreeing to [illegible]\nand fraternize with known abolitionists. When\nit comes to be fully established, that the aboli-\ntion question is not to enter into the Presidential\n[illegible], and that Southern planters may frater-\nnize with abolitionists in nominating and [illegible]\nPresidents, there will be little difficulty to the\nelection of an abolitionist. The first step\nin all such cares, is the most difficult.  The\npowerful cause, which has reconciled then\nto unite in convention, with abolitionists to make\na president, is sufficient, if permitted to\ncontinue to operate, to reconcile them to the \nelection of an abolitionist.\nTheir thinking, I trust, our state will never\nagree to take so debasing and fatal a step. It\nmay be, if she should resist the bad example,\nthat other states will follow her example\nhereafter, and that this, otherwise fatal\nstep, may be prevented from becoming a\nprecedent.\nI might add many other and [wrought?] reasons, just\ngoing in at this time, and [many?] others the disorganiza-\ntion of the party and the danger of being committed \nto the supporting a candidate, in whom we\nought not, and cannot confide.  And, also, that\nwe would have a far greater control by stand-\ning aloof, ready to throw our weight, where\nit can be done with the most effect, \nto promote our principles and policy, than\n[Page Six]\nwe probably could by going into the convention;\nbut I do not think it can be [illegible], after\nthe weighty objections, which have been stated.\nIndeed, after having refused to connect herself\nwith [illegible] for so long a period, should\ngo into one [illegible], when the objectives are so\nmuch [stronger?] than ever were before.\nI must ask the [illegible] of you, to consider\nthis addressed to all our friends, who take an \ninterest in the subject, as well as to [yours truly?]. I\nhope, if you and they concur in the views, that our\npaper will take such [illegible], as will be [calculated?]\nto discourage any movement in favor of\na convention, if, indeed, there should\nseem to be any danger of any of the kind.\nYours truly\nJ.[John] C.[Caldwell] Calhoun\nH.[Henry] W.[Workman] Conner Sr."
