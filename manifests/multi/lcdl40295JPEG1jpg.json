      "value": "Philadelphia Feb 8th 54 My Dear Sisters As the mail to Beaufort is so very irregular, I have postponed writing you until towards the Fridays boat that you may have the news all fresh. I am getting quite nervous as the days draw nigh which I have marked down in the calendar as the most miserable of my existence and all of my pleasant anticipations are temporarily shut out as a huge wave comes surging up between me & Europe and sweeping away all the romance of a European tour. However I hope with quinine, camomile tea, Stoughtons bitters & if necessary a medicinal dram to survive the shocks & throes of such a continuous volcanic eruption as [illegible] fair to seize a \"soft luxurious [slave?]\". So far we have travelled very pleasantly and I have gone over my old pleasures in showing Nat the sights about[End Page 1] the way. I suppose you have heard from the Fullers of our portraits which were taken at Washington so that we could not escape from justice or play false on the continent. Here they are. RWB 5 feet 11 1/2 inches -- forehead medium -- nose straight -- eyes hazel -- mouth rather large, chin dimpled, hair brown, complexion fair, face oval. NF 5 feet 6 inches, forehead full, nose ordinary, eyes gray, mouth small, chin round, hair brown, complexion dark, face oval. In addition to the passport I was able to obtain a [couriers] as bearer of dispatches to Paris, & if this was only on my return I could bring any quantity of dresses or lace without duty!! What a pity!! We have been spending a very pleasant time here. Aunt Bet is tolerably well, & all others quite so. I have been making inquiries about ship timber & have some letters from the Naval commander here to men in N. York about it hoping to put Papa in the way of opening a plan with them about Live Oak. Since the[End Page 2] loss of the San Francisco on account of her pine beams, live oak has risen & Commander [Grise?] tells me his nephew in NY has orders from [Nicolas?] to build some war steamers which will require oak so that I hope to accomplish something in N.Y. tomorrow & will write Papa. Do give much love to all & into the hands of a gracious & all wise God I leave all so dear to me in Carolina. Your affec brother RWB Jr.[End Page 3]"
