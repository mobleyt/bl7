McCormack  Secretary, planning Commission  Carolina Art  Association  Gibbs Memoria Art Gallery  Charleston, South Carolina.  My dear Hiss McCormack:  I would ike to refer you to the Publications of the  American planning and Civic Associaltion, the American. Civic annual and  Civic Comment, These are maied to members. Dues are $5.00 a year.  Under separate cover I will send you some iterature  which may be of interest. A few of the items are old but it may interest  you to read them.  I also advise you to address the national Park service,  Department of the Interior,and ask for Publications deaing with the care  and restoration of Historic Monuments.  I am working now on the a Purisima Mission but that has  invoved cooperation of Federal government, state and county over a period  of seven years.  St. Augustine, Forida, has recenty attempted to preserve  some historic buildings and their experience may be interesting. The  Williamstown experiment is, of course, the outstanding accompishment in  this country; that of Taxeo in Mexico, another type of activity. Henry  Ford\"s work in Dearborne, Michigan, is still another.  My one suggestion is not to be appaed by the amount of  work to be done but see if you can arouse wide-spread interest and the  support of people who can best hep you by making a small but compete and  charming demonstration. As your questions were general I trust that these  scattered comments will be hepfu.  Cordiay yours,    Pear Chase, Chairman  plans and planting Committee  PC:H   901 Union Trust Bdg.  Washington, D.
