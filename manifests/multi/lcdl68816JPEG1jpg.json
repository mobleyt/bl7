      "value": "54\nJan 7th '43\nDear Sidney,\n\" Sunshine, laughter and white beaches\"! Let that be our slogan.\nThe outrigger club sounds heaven for you. Absolutely perfect. Please describe\nit some more. How big is it? Where is it? who uses it? How many people do you\nfind there of an evening? Do you sit and eat in bathing suits? Are there flowers a\non the tables? Do you smell ginger and guardenias? My I want to go there, I want to\nlie on the white sand beside you, watch the l[i]ttle white waves beat up on the beach.\nWatch the sunset pink on the horizon, sea the palm[s]glisten in the moonlight, hear\nhawaian music drift across the soft nightair. It kills me my darling. I want to\nbe there with you so much. I am so happy for you both being able to enjoyit, to be\nliving the way you describe instead of worring about you- if you were at sea, chased\nby submarines, or on Guadacanal, or flying in bombers or a million otherupsetting\nthings that would really drive me frantic with worry. It is so wonderful my darling\nto know you two are together, happy and well[,]and able to laugh and swim, tennis.\nPleasewhen this ends lets live that sort of life together. I have always loved it\nso. Its so beautiful, so simple so close to what really counts, the earth, the sky,\nthe sea, the sunsets.\nThis city is purgatory pure and simple. The crowds, the noise, the dead\ngrey grim atmosphere. The empty life, the man made horrors of stone and cement.\nNo beauty, no nature, no color no nothing.\nAre you quite sure you have tried and KNOW that it is impossible to ask\nfor me to come out?\n[End Page 1]\n2\nIf you think you are going to be pretty permenently I should\nthink there would be a way.\nI am sorry Darling you have lost an other tennis player. You have not mentioned\nplaying tennis at all[,]and I did not even know that you had games any more. In\nfact you never mention anybody- men or women and it always gives me a picture\nof you and Morris just alw[a]ys together seeing no one. I am sure that is a wrong\npicture but the one you have given me neverthe less. [except for your Xmas dinner.]\nI can see your desks now in the dark hall.It sounds as bleak as mine. I can\nnot picture where your apartmwnt it[,]or where the Outrigger Club is[,]or how farone\nis from the other.\nI am so glad vitamin pills have cured the old man and broughthim backto act[i]ve\nlife with you again. I am sure it will be fun now with him up and around and\nbathing with you once more. Dining at the club and eating all that good food sound[s]\nso heavenly. I suppose you do it every night now. I shouldt[h]ink youwould. Do you\nmeet attractive peo[p]le there? Do you sit on a terrace, are there cabanas?\nPlease darling take some photographs for me. I long to see you and see your heaven[ly]\nsetting out there in the tropics. Nothing could make me possibl[y] more green with \nenvy or giving me a greater pang in the heart than to be here when we might be\nleading that perfect life together. How nice if when our jobs ended at 6 we could\ngo hand in hand to the Outrigger Club and laugh and swim together. It urst\nterribly not to be there. It is really agony my darling I mis[s]you so much. It\ndoes not get easier as time goes on.I find it harder and harder.\nGasolene I know is a small drop in the bucket as far as importence goes I know[,]\nbut neverthe less the new rule has gone into effect that no driving is allowed\nany more for social reasons. Only can be used to and from work. No more can I\ndine out in the station wagon. I walk, attempt to find a taxi or stay home. The\nbusses are now so deep you cant get on them. 60 people will be standing up inside\nthen. I\n[End Page 2]\n3\nWhat you eat for dinner now depends entirely on what you can get. My cook\nagrees to only work eight hours a day for 20 dollars a week so she goes home\nat seven[,]and I arrive home at eight. Well all such things are trivial I know\nin the face of a war, in the face of the suffering that is going on etc.\nI would n't mind anything. I would be quite happy to live on coacoanuts for t\nthe rest of my life if I were with you. One needs so little when one is in\na climate where the air is soft and one can live in a bathing suit. One spends\nso little, one has no desire to buy anything. Its the simplicity that I long\nfor with you. No more of those worries when you lock your self up in the\noffice for hours to work over the books, the farm accounts, the repair budgets\nand the like.I dont believe one has to be involved like that.You and I have a\nalways been so happy doing the simple things, Portofino, the little house in\nParis,St Jean, the little cages on the squaire,motoring with tennis racquets\nto Bastaad, eating an omlet and salad on a checkered cloth in some tiny french\nvillage. The simple things are always the pleasantest.I want to live by the sea\nand enjoy all the heavenly descriptions that you picture to me in your letters.\nI hope that if and when the war is over we may be allowed to laugh and love\nand live on a beach together.\nThe war in Africa is not very bright and again to me the war looks\nlong... str[e]tching out ahead for many months and months to come. It is an\nupsetting world, a dislocated world[,]and a world that will be hard to adjust\nitself again to normal living. The post War world will be tough but I dont care\nhow tough if I can have you in it beside me my darling.\nPlease telephone me. I would not know when to call you now as\nI would probably call when you are at the Outrigger Club. Maybe you ad better\ngive me the number of the outrigger Club[,]or else do what I suggested telephone\nme[,]and reverse the call. Please reverse the call however because those phone\ncalls are expensive and it would eliminate your salary check as thought it were\nmade of steam. \nI hope you take no courses on anything so you wont get sent away\nlike that tennis partner of yours in fourty seconds. I think if you two are\ngood executive administrators[,]tha[t] you would be so missed that they could not\nafford to let you goI Dont you think so? Have you heard any rumors to the\ncontrary? I do hope not.\nYour letters are wonderful sweetheart and I love each and every\none[,]and read them over and over again.\nDont forget to send me some snapshots.\nLots of love to you sweet heart.Pretend those little waves \non the beach come all the way from America with love to caress your\nsweet ears. My I would give a million million million dollars and all the\nsugar plums in the world to see you, to touch you, to kiss you with a bigg\nbig hug and hold you tight tight .\nYour-\nGertie.\n[End Page 3]"
