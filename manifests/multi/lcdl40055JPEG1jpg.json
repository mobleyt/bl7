      "value": "Beaufort April 6th 1846 My Dear Brother: You will, perhaps, 'ere this has reached you, have heard of my sad and painful affliction in the death of my dear companion. Oh! It is a melancholy and doleful visitation. But I know that a kind and merciful God does not afflict his children, willingly. He has, I am convinced, some benevolent end in view in thus subjecting me to tribulation and sorrow. May it be [illegible] to my spiritual benefit. May it bring me nearer and closer to my Jesus. He, and He alone, can sustain me under the [illegible] of my sorrow. Pray to him, my dear friend, in my behalf, that He may support and comfort me in this trial. Do you know of any respectable lady in Charleston, who would be suited to take charge of my children (two)? I would prefer an English lady about middle age and of decidedly pious views. To such I could afford a home, and a reasonable compensation, with very little to attend to farther than the undivided attention to two lovely cherubim. If you know of anyone, whom you could highly recommend, let me know as soon as possible, as well as the wages she would require. I am Dear Sir your deeply stricken brother in Christ. J. Fielding In haste [End Page 1] Revd Fielding April 6 1846 Rev W.H. Barnwell Charleston S.C. per Steam Boat [End Page 2]"
