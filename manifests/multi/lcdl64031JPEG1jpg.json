      "value": "Beaufort Sept. 2nd 1819- My Dear Madam It is with heart felt sorrow I attempt to address a few lines to you at this time. With a sincere desire, if it be possible to offer some degree of comfort and consolation under this melancholy bereavement, I assure you My Dear Madam that your bereavement on this occasion is mine also. For certainly his affectionate attentions to me endeared him as an own Son, and I consider his loss to myself and little orphan Gr children, incalculable, and I assure you the chief consolation I had under the heavy bereavement of my beloved and ever to be lamented Daughter, was the possession of so amiable a Father to her children and so affectionate a Friend to myself. Few therefore can sympathize with you more sincerely than I do. The event has indeed opened afresh the wounds in my bleeding heart and in a great measure unhinged my resignation. If I then feel the acuteness of sorrow on this occasion what must the Parents of the best Sons do. Ah! my Dear Friends I assure you none can realize the keenness of your sorrows better than myself. I have been taught in the school of affliction how to feel for others, it is not the first time I have felt the parting pang of separation from those I loved most dearly- But still [although I know by experience all human aid is insufficient to bring us com- [End Page 1] -fort when we are immediately under the afflicting rod] I feel it my duty as a Christian, to endeavour, to lead you to that scource from whence I have myself on these melancholoy occasions received comfort. It is in times of affliction My Dear Mrs. Heyward, that we more especially find that there is a reality in Religion and that consolation is to be derived from no other scourse. Let me therefore entreat you to fly to the covenant of grace [on which you have laid hold, by the profession of faith you made at the Lords table] for support under this trial. The Bible assures us that the promises are sure and certain to Believers, let us then with faith trust in the promise that all things shall work together for good to them that love God. And however dark and mysterious the dispensations of providence are to you and I at present- let us endeavour [as Believers in the Christian Religion] to trust that eventually these severe and trying affliction may be sent for our benefit, perhaps to wean us more from the world. and to lead us to sett our affections more on things about, for surely nothing can be better calculated to lessen our interest in the world that the repeated loses we sustain by the Death of Friends   and to turn our thoughts to a more serious consideration of that plan of Salvation, which is laid down in the Scriptures, so well calculated to prepare as for a better inheritance, where there is no sorrow, or change of time or parting with friends, but an eternity of happiness, Let us endeavour to consider our blessed Redeemer not only as dying to purchase Salvation for us, but also as our high Priest, who is exalted at the right hand of God to make continual intercession for us. Believers have a right according to the scripture declaration to carry all [End Page 2] their sorrows to a throne of grace and have a full assurance that God will always hear their petitions whenever made in the Name of a Redeemer-I sincerely hope you may be enabled by devine grace, to commit yourself in this affliction into the hands of an unerring God who has promised that he will never leave nor forsake his people in time of trouble---I beg you will thank Mr. Heyward for the attention of sending me so quickly the melancholy news. I hope he received safely an answer to it, which My Son Edwd was so kind as to write for me. I feel much at hearing how prevalent the yellow fever is in Charleston but hope from the healthiness of your situation our poor little boys may be preserved from the contagion. Paul told us of Mrs. Manigaults confinements. I hope she is quite well. I am happy to tell you the two [page torn] dear children I have are quite loved [page torn] little girl improves daily she is about teeth now which causes her to be a little unwell from time to time. but nothing to complain of James begins to speak very prettily. pray remember me affectionately to Mrs. M. Mr. Heyward and your family generally- Kiss my Edward and Nat. and tell Elizabeth howdie- I remain with the sincerest Esteam yours Mary Barnwell-- [End Page 3] Beaufort SC September 3d Mrs. Barnwell Mrs. Nathl. Heyward- Charleston S. Carolina [End Page 4]"
