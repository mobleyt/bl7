  "description": "Satirical scene etched in red depicting four members of the committee around a treasure chest, which is empty of coins and occupied by a grinning demon. The Secretary holds upside down an empty bag inscribed \"ils ont emigrè\" (\"they have emigrated\"). One of the committee members takes from a Jew (at left) a dish on which a little demon is excreting coins. On the right, a large cupboard with packages labeled Recepissen (receipts) and Assignats (paper money issued during the French Revolution) falls forward on to the backs of two committee members, including the president of the Committee of Accounts. The Jew sells a figure which he assures the purchaser will, if nourished with the tears of the Orangists, give fifty ducats daily. This is better than the piles of assignats which threaten ruin. Territories conquered by France during the Revolution were forced to take assignats from French soldiers and to change them for receipts. Etching by William Humphrey after a caricature by David Hess. From Hollandia regenerata by David Hess.",
