      "value": "J M J Ursuline Convent Columbia, S.C. April 14th/60 My dearest Brother I suppose you have seen the Sisters of Mercy who left here on yesterday, in the noon-day train, to meet the steamer Marion-- according to the advice of their Mother Superior We were most fortunate in seeing Mr Lafitte, who offered most politely to spare you all trouble, & meet them at the cars-- not only this, he said he would see Capt Forester, & arrange every thing for them-- was not that kind, especially when he spoke as tho “we confined a favor on him” in allowing him to serve us--. Mrs E Bellinger came up yesterday evening, with her son Joseph, the bride, & Miss M Bellinger-- she seems charmed at seeing her [written on side of page:] the advancement of religion in Charleston-- Please let me know very soon, & when shall we see you ? Pray for us all especially for you own Sister Ellen Sr Baptiste [written at top left hand side of page:] 15 Apr. 1860 Mad. M B Lynch [written at top right hand side of page:] do you think it better not to take stock &c, of course we will be guided entirely by you-- not only as our superior, but best friend & Father as well as Brother, we only are planning for the future Diocese [illegible] Convent[End Page 1] three daughters so well & happy-- & regrets she did not see Sr Teresa's reception-- (Why did not the Misceleny publish it, & the pretty poetry?). I laughed heartily over Mrs Bellingers account of the wedding, & preceding difficulties--. Bishop McGill wrote to Sr [illegible], & told her, that you no doubt had mentioned he would be here in May-- so she expects to be received by him then-- I would like to know the precise time when--. We have a little sickness at present Sr [illegible] (one of the Phila Srs) has fever, but is not at all dangerous-- Sr Martha (a professed Sr) has also been sick a little, not yet fit for duty-- but Sr Rose is much better--. and the rest quite well, thank God-- I begin to feel quite anxious about our Distribution, but try to remember that all is in the hands of Providence, & under the powerful protection of our Blessed Mother--. We enjoyed two interesting visits from Mr Baldwin of Richmond Va-- who is inquisitive about the doctrine of our Church-- he seemed very much pleased with his visit-- & Sr [illegible: Joanna?] is delighted that I went down & treated him so friendly-- [He?] lectured with much applause here-- John was very much pleased, &[End Page 2] called on him. John proposed to me today our taking stock in a \"Building Committee\"-- the shares of which, are almost all taken & soon will be-- His doing so, arose from his presenting me a bill for the posts of the fence-- I told him, I thought he ought to keep account of all he paid out in that way, for we thought it better, since we had evidence constantly of the unfitness of this place for a convent, that you should never give it to us, but let us rent it from you, at what-ever you thought a reasonable price by the year, & sell it to the first good purchaser you could get-- Instead of giving us a house, you could if you chose give to us in the way of rent, as much as you intended--, which was $3.000 was it not, the value of the old house? John says now is the time for those who wish to build cheaply-- that is, this \"Building Committee\" will facilitate-- By taking stock now, & paying the interest monthly $100.00 on if borrowing $300.00 monthly-- we could look about quietly taking our time & choose a location, & slowly accomplish the building of our convent. By taking the hundred shares which John proposes we could borrow $20.000 to work upon-- if I could only calculate with certainty to meet the payment of $200.00 every month--[End Page 3] I asked John if there were land adjoining the Church that we could purchase & join our Convent on to it, so as to give our services as sacristan? & Choir to the Church, for the benefit of religion, & as remuneration for the services of the Pastor-- In this small & slowly growing plan, it would be easy for us to do better than those who now fulfil those duties-- & we do these for ourselves & might as well let others enjoy what we do-- if it be AMDG--. However, this is for After Consideration-- I would be very glad though if you would consider about the \"building committee\" & give me your advice as early as possible-- John says he will attend to the business, if we will enter upon it, but there is no time to lose--. I suppose Anna is again with our dear Parents-- Are you thinking of going out to Texas-- they are expecting you constantly-- Mrs Dr Spann is preparing to be Baptised a Catholic-- Revd J Gounard is delighted--. How very fortunate you were is the purchase of the Presbyterian Church-- it was nuts to Mr Lafitte-- I am happy to see such zeal for[End Page 4]"
