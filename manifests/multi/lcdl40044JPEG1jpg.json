      "value": "Beaufort March 18 1844 My Dear Brother, I send you paper for the Ep. Prot. It is longer than I intended to make it. If you think it worth inserting, you can keep it till such time as you may need a paper somewhat long. I was much gratified & pleased with the way & spirit in which your \"wrong-headedness\" put the churchmen & [illegible]. \"Meekness of wisdom\" is a blessed thing. May the Lord Jesus ever give you to have & use it. I am glad too to see you have an \"our church department.\" Did Jesus & his [sheep?], thro' his apostles, establish a church, ministry &c? If he did, it must have been in some [illegible] shape. What he did his wisdom must have done as good & necessary. What form did his church bear? The question is debated to have been his own Duty--so is the matter of the souls justification, infant Baptism &c. Because some questioned & argued from Scripture against these doctrines, am I to give them up or hold them as uncertain or unimportant? What is my duty? To pray & [preach?] the scriptures [illegible]--and having come to a conclusion, to abide, but humbly but firmly & charity. To such conclusion, I long ago[End Page 1] came & I see no reason now to depart from it or hold it lightly or lowly. If I thought any ministry [& all ministries] valid, I should see no reason to find fault with Garret & certain men, who lately held a convention in New York to establish a new church of their own--an abolition church. I should see no reason to question the principle: I'll ordain you & you shall ordain me.\" Why do we pray against schism, as well as false doctrine & heresy? If short my Dear Brother my opinions are and ever have been those expressed by Bishop Eastburn, as printed in your last paper: particularly in the last paragraph: \"This [being?] the [illegible].\" And this [illegible] I could casually [illegible] [illegible] would more [illegible] [illegible]. I am satisfied the result would in [connexion?] with your gospel spirit, be good especially in the country. We have [illegible] of doctrine & people are tested to [illegible] men lying in [illegible] to [promptly?]. And many enemies of our church use your name against the church. You are on the surface of your hopes more anxious to show that others are not wrong, than that we are right. Forgive me my Dear Brother in these hasty & perhaps inadvisable remarks & believe me in sincerest love & most earnest prayer, your brother in Jesus' Family Jos. R. Walker Rev. Wm H. Barnwell[End Page 2] For The Rev. Wm H. Barnwell Charleston S.C. By Miss Amelia Rose [Lower left hand margin] Rev. J.R. Walker 1844 [End Page 3]"
