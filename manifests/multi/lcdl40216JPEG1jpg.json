      "value": "Columbia college, Oct 13th 1847. My Dear Mamma. It is now an half hour before study hours & I will devote that time to writing to you as I promised in Ted’s letter-- I have not received any letter since those brought by Wm Lowndes but expect one this evening-- My time is passing quite agreably & I hope profitably-- my quarters are not yet fixed as comfortably as I would like, from want of funds & also, on account of Joseph Mellichamp-- who did not want to put himself to any expense--. On this account I content myself with 1 basin stand & 1 basin between us-- which is rather inconvenient-- When I left home I expected to wait until December to furnish my room-- but as I fortunately got a vacant one, I was obliged to procure furniture at once-- I have bought-- a clothes press-- & a cot matress-- and paid for half of the following articles-- 4 chairs a basin stand, basin, glass & candles-- & dipper-- so that the expenditures of room come to. $13.50.-- I shall want a centre table-- I can get one for $2-- a tub for slop water-- & 2 candle sticks-- These Joseph Mellichamp & myself will buy to gether & square off when we part-- I will wait until[End Page 1] Wm Johnson comes to procure some more chairs a book case basin stand &c-- Dr Lieber has ordered us to buy a Butlers Ancient Atlas-- Tell Papa that McCarter & Allen have a branch up here as extensive as the one in Charleston, where books can be procured-- as well-- so that any text books I need I may get here-- As I mentioned, I have become a member of the Euphradian Society & for these reasons-- After a weeks acquaintance with the students here-- I was convinced by the cordiality of the Euphradians that I would pass a more agreable time as a member of that Society than if I joined the Clariosophics who seemed anxious for me to join-- only as it would be an increase to the number & seemed rather indifferent about it altogether-- & besides I had the opportunity of forming new acquaintances among the E_s without encountering the prejudices which I Knew existed against me in the Clariosophic in the persons of many of my old classmates, Several of the friends I have made here & all of the Euphradian-- & the majority of my class-- a comittee offered me the office of Secretary-- but I declined as it is rather troublesome & I preferred to[End Page 2] to be free to debate, which is the chief benefit to be derived--. Dr Henry called me up this evening on Greek, when he set us the lesson he made a long speech saying that as the period was short before the examinations came on-- we must get [has?] long lessons as possible-- of course I expected 500 lines & at any rate 250-- & lo & behold it was 50-- and of the 2d book too-- & 3 1/2 years ago I got 100--. So in Latin-- our longest lesson is 60 lines-- IN Mathematics-- 4 prop-- of the 4th book-- & history 8 pages once a week-- It is literally nothing so that I employ my time in reading I have taken Arnolds Rome out of the Library & am reading it carefully & mean for the present to employ myself in Reading, at the same time studying the lessons carefully-- A full grown man of 23. has just entered our class.-- & he has the reputation of being very smart-- so I will have to be “up & doing”-- but still with “a heart for every fate” Mr Preston came into Commons yesterday-- & took a seat next to me where he gave me an opportunity of seeing his insincerity-- as he commenced praising the coffee as being as good as he had ever drank, when positively it was so bad that he but sipped it & then put it down-- --[End Page 3] Joseph Mellichamp has just returned from the post office & announces that there is no letter for me-- so I must send this-- I would be glad if Papa would send me some money immediately, as I am upon my last dollar & this is to go to a subscription-- for Col Butlers family-- which the citizens of Richland have sent here & has been universally subscribed to-- Give much love to Aunt Mathews & all the children-- Tell Papa I belong to the Euphradian-- he will Know what I mean. & Give much love to him-- & accept-- no less yourself from Your affec Son R W Barnwell. Mrs. Wm H. Barnwell. Charleston. So. Carolina[End Page 4]"
