      "value": "S. C. College Sep. 30th 1843. Rev, and Dear Sir, I received your prospectus and accompanying letter yesterday evening from Mr. Neill. You are quite mistaken in supposing that if I had been consulted in the matter I would have dissuaded you from the enterprise. So far from it I should have urged the matter upon you with all my might. The desolutions of Zion are [a?] [illegible] enough to call every true believer to fasting, sack cloth and prayer. The enemy is coming [too?] like a flood and few, very few are resisting his encroachments. The condition of the Church has been to me so distressing a subject for the last few months that I have taken shelter in the doctrine of the pre-millenial advent of Christ. It is a cheering hope that Jesus shall come in person and establish His Own Kingdom on the earth, rooting up every plant which His heavenly Father hath not planted and casting out all things that offend. My constant prayer now is-- Come Good Jesus, Come quickly. The deadly wound of the beast is rapidly healing up and nothing can now reach him but the breath of the Saviour's mouth. Still we must be faithful though we save none but ourselves.[End Page 1] I have no idea whatever that you will be able to accomplish any permanent change in the condition and prospects of your Church-- The two fatal millstones which must forever keep you down, as it seems to me, are the doctrines of apostolical succession and Episcopal authority. I do not believe that a prelatical church can be a pure church. You may have here and there godly men and pious congregations-- but there are too many influences at work upon the pride, vanity and ambition of the human heart, to keep the body sound. Then [illegible: hole in page. again?] the [nexus?] which bends the parts together is entirely too slight to produce any permanent effect. Episcopacy is independency upon a large scale. It is a collection of petty sovereignties, equal in power and authority and, of course, independent in their jurisdiction-- Each Bishop is a monarch and each diocese a commonwealth. For diocese [read?] churches and for Bishops [read?] Pastors and you have Congregationalism-- at least-- the worst element of it-- the insulation of the parts. The supremacy of some Universal Bishop is essential, it strikes me, to give unity and harmony to the Prelatical system. I must think therefore that you beat the air in attempting to accomplish a reformation in a body which possesses the fundamental principles upon which the system against which you war has been seared. To a decided Presbyterian Popery is [Fallacy?] fully developed. [End Page 2] You see that I draw largely upon your charity and good feeling in thus fully expressing my sentiments upon the natural workings of a scheme which you love. You feel none of these effects because you are Kept and guarded by the Holy Ghost; and I [illegible: hole in page. believe?] that God intends to make you an instrument through which His truth shall be proclaimed to thousands who will despise it and persecute you. My profoundest sympathies are with you, my heartfelt prayers are for you and my assistance shall be freely given whenever needed. The truth of God-- the glorious doctrines of grace can never find any advocate who [loves?] them and feels their power in whom I do not [illegible: page torn] [illegible: hole in page] brother and a friend. I wish you, therefore, in your projected enterprise a cordial Godspeed-- and if [the?] issue should be your firm conviction that [prelacy?] is irreclaimable I shall not lament the process by [which?] you shall have reached it. I hope that I shall have the pleasure of seeing you in Columbia during the winter. I long to have a full, free and frank conversation with you upon many things which deeply concern the prosperity of Zion. Have you thought upon the question of the premillenial advent? What are your views in regard to it? My mind has been unusually exercised upon this matter and I think that God's hand is in it. Yr Sincere Fd. & Bro. J.H. Thornwell.[End Page 3] Rev Mr Thornwell Sep 30 1843-- To the Reverend William H. Barnwell Charleston S.C. [End Page 4]"
