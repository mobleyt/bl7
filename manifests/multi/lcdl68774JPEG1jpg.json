      "value": "Do your orders emulate from Sincpack or Carminch?\n43 recvd 12 28 42 Dec 17th\nDear Doodle-ears,\nI got back from Andalusia this morning. Olive and I decided to\nwe should go and see Kathrine together and spend a day with her - so I told my office\nI wanted the day off and took it. We went up on a nine A.M. train on the coldest\nday I have ever felt.I think it was 18[percent] we changed and wairted an hour at North\nPhilla and than Kathrine met us at Andalusia. Both Olive and Kathrine had such\ncolds they could hardly speak. This ofcourse made no difference to Kathrine\nwho put on her woolen underwear and took me for an hour's walk over snow and\nice around the roads we all bycicled over together last summer. Olive stayed\nby the fire. We spent most of the day conversing. It was great fun.Kathrine\nI really adore and we had a \"talk Fest\". She had gone to NJ. to see Morris'\noffspring,and found Nancy looking in the pink on a very fine corner room on\nthe River. She had been to Fort Bragg to see Henry and hopes Henry will get\nhas leave. Little Charlie a senior at St Pauls is studdying to be an air\npilot when called. Little Bobbie Phillips has joined the Marines but will\nstay at Colledge till called. Big Charlie came back for dinner and we re-\nviewed the entire Legendre situation with him. All the details about Armant[,]\nand read them your funny letter about you and Morris in the car witha bottle\n[o]f champaine out in the flood when the river bubbled around you. We had great\nfun. I took the ten o'clock train home and took the sleeper from Broad St.\nwhich got me in at 7 A.M. Everyone is snuffling anfgurggling and you have never\nseen such colds in your life. I have not yet had a scorcher. That no doubt lies\nin wait for me later on.\nI had the great Ace for dinner Col. Carmaichel, his wife,\nChar[l]ie Baskerville and Moorhead.I think I told you something about this in\nmy last letter. Olive ate it up. The Flyer was the top. Only 29 and a Clolonel\n-just as modest and sweet as he could be. He let me in on the \"Short Snorters[\"]\nClub\" because I had flown the ocean,so we all exchnaged dollare bills with\nour respective signatures. Do you know about the\"Short Sorters?\" ? I guess so.\nHe and his wife must have had fun because they never went home till nearly\none A.M. I could n't believe it. He was so cute about his delight at being\nonce more in a private house,and said it was the best evening he had had\nsince he has been back. He gets 15 days[,]then a new assignement. He told me\nhe was pleased and enthused at what the Air effort here consisted of. He thought\nit was tops and had only the highest praise for Arnold. I liked him.\nI am going to have dinner on a tray to-night,and then to-morrow\nIdine with David Bruce at the Aliby Club. Xmas is getting awfully close and\n[I] have not done half my shopping.\nI sent you an other little picture frame to-day air-mail with\ntwo photos which I hope you will like. Ofcourse I dont expect this to reach\nyou before Xmas possibly. I do hope my mail has started to arrive again and\nthat you are getting letters.\nMy fingers are crossed for you to stay in Hawaii and I wish\nthe same wish every day. If wishewere helpful- you have mine,and you should\nstay there without a counter order,.Iam always so frightened I shall here you\nare off. How I hope if you do go anywhere I do hope you go to-gether. It\nwould be so perfect for you.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nWhen you are two you can take care of each other and I like to think of you two\nalways staying together and taking care of eachother. Incidently [I] dont guess its\nreally care you give each other -it seems to me you are trying to poison eachother\nwith those concoctions you whip up. How does the old indegestion stand it? I would\nreally like to know. When I think of the time spent at Mr.Martins' Mrs Bett's, Dr\nGreen etc and how we babied the old tumtum along with milk and home cooking- ye\nGods it makes me wince to think of the canned goods that float or sink inside your\ninnards,and the pies, cakes and goodies mixed and brewed by Chef Morris that explode\nlike bombs below your deck[or rather girth[] How is the old body bearing up? Will\nyou be wanting only milktoast and soft foods when you get back or will you be ready\nfor hardtack -pork and beans[?] I long to know. Where do you keep the Bicarb? Is it\nright beside the Rhum on the Kitchen shelf? I hope so. I would love to have a\nphonagraph record of some of those kitchen capers you two ahrangue over as I bet\nit would make me laugh.\nHoney is back ehre with me as Landine moved to Middleburg to\nfinish up her school as Foxcroft closed earlier. Honey is very sweet and he now\nget a great deal of petting. My pupy Jeep is still with Mrs Cornell being trained\nfor these pearly grey rugs.\nLizzie has now also returned to the Plantation as Johnie her\nhusband wanted her to and made such a row she had to go. We are left once more\ncompletely alone with Rose to cook for us all over the Xmas hollidays. Hi ho what\na life. Its fine for me as Rose is a swell cook but whether she can hold out is\nan other pr[o]blem. She really should have a holliday with Sherin over Xmas but I see\nno chance of it. She made an other trip to N.Y.C. to canvas the Agencyes but has\nno luck at all. No one will come to Washington at any price- nohow.\nNorth Afica seems to be going fine, and I wonder where Janie is\nin the midst of all those air raids. Probably entertaining Fifi andBaba and Tulio\nand all the other people that sounded like that to me. She probably finds it \"very\ninteresting\" although a little hard to get caviar. I wonder.\nI am having a little tiny table tree this year as I have no Xmas\ndeccorations but it will look gay and then I have bought the children stockings\nand am giving Landine a leather writing case from you and Bo a trycycle form Daddy.\nI shall miss you so my Darling I try not to think about it. Do you remmeber last\nXmas what fun we had at Medway. Bo was wide eyed surrounded by red and white tissue\npaper. Xmas never means much in the tropics anyhow but I do hope you get your parcels\nand I do hope that by now Wing Pepper has brought you those foolish little goodluck\npieces that I send you with all my love. The fourleaf clover is to put on that key\nring I gave you[if you still have it] It will bring you luck.I know it will.\nThere is not point sending you big things.You never will be able to pack them- so\nI sent you food, nonsence, books and magazenes.\nI shall telephone you son.\nLoads of love to you both,but the mostest to you my darling whom\nI hug and kiss over and over again.\nGertie\n[illegible]\n[End Page 2]"
