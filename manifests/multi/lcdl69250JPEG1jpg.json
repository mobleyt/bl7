      "value": "March 8, 1943\nHello Sweet,\nMonday morning and raining. Can any combination be\nbetter. Yesterday was overcast and there were no waves so we\ncould not surf, but I feel I can not complin after my wonderful week\nat the shooting school.\nYou have asked me whether I ever received The United\nState News. I get it regularly and both Morris fnd I think it is\nbetter in many respect than Time. I also received Oeschener \nbohk and we have both read and liked it a great deal. At present \nanother man in the office is reading it but has not told,me what \n-he thought. I also received the tennis balls but am certain that \nI told you so in a previous letter, it will probably arrive when the\nwar is over. \nI would certainlyraise Sams wages ten dollars as he\nis tho only thing between the skies and Medway. By that I mean\nthe roof would leak and the windows wou d fall out andthe sheds\nwould collapse if he left. He is invaluable, more so than Miss\nFinucan because youcould always have the firm in New York keep your\nbooks but nothing will hold that old place together except a carpenter\nand electrician working hand in handwihth God.\nI do not understand Ericson saying that as you were not.\nliving in South Carolina you will not have to pay taxes. First\nYou have to be a resident of some state and you cannot claim\nmaryland as you own property in South Ghrolina and lived there for\nfive months of this year. Secondly South Carolina will look\nwith suspicion on your changing your residence so quickly after only\n,half a year add you will undoubtly have trouble with them. Thirdly\nwhat state does he want-you pg pay taxes in, probably New York so it\nwill be easier for him as he knows what the New York laws are;\npersgnaly I would not chanfe as I do not see any advantage  o doing\nso. We know how difficult New York State has always been wath you\nand the trouble they have given us and unless there is a decided\nadvantage being a citizen of scme other state I would stay in\nSouth Carolina until we decide where wo wish to live.\nUndobtly you will receive this letter after youhave\nreturned from Medway and needless to ssy_I sm crazy to hear how you\nliked your trip there,whether you were bored with tfe place and still\nhad that frustrated feeling or whether time and experience in\nWashington made you look upon it with a less critical eye. I\nsuppose Rose is now a complete wreck and can do little more than e\ncrawl on hands end kness wbout the pl ce after coping with all the\nnigresses and their stupidity; I do hope you had wonderful weather\nand that nothing marred the Field Marshalls visit. It can be\na lovely place as long as the water runs and the lights work,\nand it can be terrible when evertyning including the servants\n[End Page 1]\nbecome tempremental. After living there for a while it reminds me\nof the women who was beating the drum in a salvation army band. \nAfter finishing s tune the leader stepped forward and said we will\nnow have a few words from sister Sue. Sister Sue stpeeped forward\nand said \"before joing the salvation Army I use to smoke, I use to\ndrink, at least a quart a day flowed down my gullet, I use to\nsin.\" She paused dramatically and then finished now that I am in\nthe salvation army I don't do a dam thing but beat this lousy\nserum a1Lday. Medway is very much like that , when away we do\na xxxxxxxhxxxx million thing[s], but afterbeing there for a month\none does nothing but worry. \nHave you heard anything more about being able tocome out\nhere. I do hope it omes through, but want to warn you that you\nwill not have to xxxx know my apartment address because you will\narive so quickly. Unless you are an Admiral you will go to\nSan Francisco and w ait there for transportation about two weeks,\nthen you will be put on a ten day covoy ship and will arrive here\njust one month after leaving Washington. The aeroplanes ase so crow\nded that you will not have a chance of ogetting on one, commanders\nand even captains have been unable to obtain nasseage so I do not\ntuink your chances are so good. Lets hope for the best however.\nGoodbue sweetheart, with all my love\nSidney\n[End Page 2]"
