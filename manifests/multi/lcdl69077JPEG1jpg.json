      "value": "Original\ncopy sent to American\nEmbassy\n32\nAugust 7, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nIt is Sunday night and a lovely day has passed\nthat you would have enjoyed. In the morning I arose at seven th\nirty, cooked breakfast and lounged around the aprtment until\nten thirty. Then I stro led over to the Outrigger club and\nsun bathed and swam alternatelingly until one thirty when I\nhad lunch. It was so lovely lo king at the blue sea, the\nwhite breakers, the dark b dies of the men skimming over the\nsunlit w ter, and the distant horizon curving from\nDiamond head away out to sea and then back again to the mountains\nin the north. After lunch Morris who had stayed in bed\nall morning an I went out house hunting, but with no success alth \nough I have found out a certain amount about property values ,\nthe cost of land etc. Believe me it is high, like Palm Beach.\nI suppose that people do not want to sell because they are not\ns re what they can do with the money. Afterwards we played \ntennis doubles with Sargeant Kahnamoku, and a boy called\nCrowley. It was not much fun as they did not play well and\nit was difficult to have a rally. Sargeant Dukes brother,is\nvery n ce b t has not the charm that Duke has. After dinner of\nsoup at six thirty I lay down on my bed and read part of the\nForest and the Fort by Hervey Allen. There were such\nwonderful word picutres of Autumn in the Indian country that\nI longed to see the smoke curl up slowly from the fires ,\nsmell it in the air, see the big crimson leaves float down and\nhave th t lovely country of valleys and rivers lie before me.\nDo you remember how l vely it was even in spots around Ithaca,\nand on the ride down from Amsterdam one fall we sa w such\nvivd coloring that I have always remembered it. The b ck itself\nis not marvellous, apparently it is to be the first one of a\nseries of six on the Indi n wars, a history of the early days\nin this country.\nThe radio brought the bad news that we are all quaranti\nin the Waikii distrcit. I will be allowed to go back and forth\nto work but that is all. On return from work I have to go\nstraight to my apartment and stay there until I le ve to go\nmorning for work again. There is n epidemic of Dengue fever\nand the army and navy has slapped this order on this district.\nI am sorry that swimming and tennis etc. stop at revelry\ntomorrow morning for an indefinite length of time. Morris that\nlucky stiff is leaving on a ship tomorrow morning and will\nprobably miss it all by the time he gets back. Ah well c'est\nla guerre. It will probably mean that I will stay at the\noffice longer and do more work so th t is all to the good,\nbecause I ill being giving more to my goverment than I have\nin the past.\n[End Page 1]\nYour letter from the river club, written late at night,\nwas received and I felt so sorry for you because you were\nlonely and tired. I could tell by the letter what the tro ble\nwas. You were over tired and did not real ze it. You do not\nrealize how much Washington has taken out of you, and then a\nweek end at Pollys is not the most restful thing that I know \nof. My advise is th t you go up to Watch Hill and stay there with\nthe children for two weeks and not do anything but lie on the\nbeach, eat andppull Honeys ears. At first you will probably\nthink you are going mad because you want to do something os\nmuch, then after a while you will suddenly feel very tired and\nsleep all the time, after this you will beggin to feel your\nself again. I am only suggesting this as I know you will\nnot do it,\nYour discription of meeting the old general is delightful.\nCould anyth ng be stupider than having to go on a British ship.\nOf course if they send you on a portugese one I believe you\nautomaticaly receive the Navy Cross and the army distinguid\nservice medal for just agreeing to go. If the cockroaches do not\ncarry away a leg the fleas will. Personally I would rahter take\nmy chances in the old Washington office\nLast night we went to the movie at the royal Hawaiian\nand saw Betty Grable in \"Coney Island\". The sail rs love her a\nand whistle and shout whenever she moves. They sometimes make\nvery funny remarks that are earthy and to the point. This\npicutre ia alabout a beer hall on Coney that Grable is singing\nat. A man ith great showmanship takes hold of her and tried\nto te ch her how to sing with ut jumping over the stage l ke\na rabbit. He is unable to until he puts handcuffs on her\nlegs and arms and the plants her in one spot just before the\ncurtain goes up. Unable to spring about like an antelope she\nsings and of course brings the house down, and lau ches on a\nfamous career where you are shown a shower of newspaper\nheadings with her name head lined. It is down in the appro ed\nhollywood manny and thought the story is not marvellous\nthe use of tecn icolor is edcellent and gives some wonderful\neffects especially in a song which she sings rom a river boat.\nDid you have Rose stop the flowers from Sm lls or\nhave them sent to the children in Watch Hills. If not the person\nwho rented the house from you will be slightly surprised to receive\nflowers xxxxxxxx one a week without any warning. Also if you\nsee the priceless R se ag in tell her to be sure and store out\ngolf clubs lying down as otherwise they will all be bent li e\nbows when the war is over. When I come back I do not want to\nlive in one place right away.. I want to go to Maine, Forida,\nVirginia, come out to Honolulu, see Austalia and New Zealans\netc. I don't particulay want to go to Europe I have seen that\nso many times, that there is li tle int rest there compared to\nthe pl ces we h ve not seen.\nGoodbye dea, I send you all my love.\nSidney J Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
