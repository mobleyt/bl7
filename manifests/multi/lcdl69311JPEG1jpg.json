      "value": "18\nOctober 21, 1942 \nDear Gertie,\nI have your letter of the thirteenth and quite agree\nwith you that the plantation should be rented. Even though you\nmay not receive five hundred a month for it, I believe it would\nbe better to take two hundred and have the house occupied than\nto let it sit. The advantage of it being occupied is more than\nsimply having it heated and taken care of during the winter months.\nTennants will prevent any vandalism, and this is what I am afraid\nof during this winter when the workers on the project next door\ndiscover we will not be there.\nYou really sound as if you are the hardest worker\nin the world. I would collapse if I worked every night until\neight as you do. Certainly habit is a curious thing. It controls\nour ability and endurance, and ten hours a day in time probably\nappears to be normal, though at first it seems as if we can\nhardly live through lt. Your job must be interesting, and I\nthink the enlarging of your office and the taking on of additional\nsecretaries is proof of your ability. Really, I am so proud of\nyou, and so happy at the thought that on my return I will be able\nto lie in a hammock with my jug of corn liker while you run\neverything, that my disposition has changed completely.\nEven though you did not get the fat spaniel that\nliked to eat I am certain that the other is very sweet, and will\nprobably become very fat by the time Rose and Lucy are through with\nhim. Please give him a big hug for ms, and be sure to pull\nhis ears and tell him I hope to come home some day and give him\n[End Page 1]\nlots of little susages at breakfast time.\nYou have no doubt received my letter telling you about \nthe telephone conversation. I never left the hotel except to\ngo out on the beach Sunday. The trouble was that they never\ncalled me. I have never spent a night away from the hotel except\nwhen I go to the Navy Yard when we work late at the office, so it\nis ridiculous for the operator to say that I am not there.\nHowever the phone situation is a little balled up and they really\nhave a very hard time running people down when they have to talk\nthrough hotel operators who have some difficult in speaking\nEnglish themselves.\nThere is not the slightest doubt in mymind, but that\nI have the best of theplaces we are stationed in. Each day I\nrealize more and more how really lovely it is here. There is\nno change. You can count on the same temperature every morning,\nthe same brillant sunshine and the evening I know will bring a\nwonderful swim, dinner, moonlight, palm trees and my radio.\nIt is heaven and would be absolutley perfect if you were only here.\nI cannot think of working in a city any more than you. But the\ncombination of work and this setting is a very happy one.\nThe work prevents boredom, makes you appreciate your days off,\nwhile at the same time every evening is a day off in itself as\nthere is paddl[e] tennis andswimming,so that you forget all about\nthe office and sitting in a chair and life becomes a balanced\nprocession of work and play, and a very agreeable one. Don't let\nanyone tell you the boys in Hawaii are suffering, because it\nwould be impossible unless they force themselves to trump u[p]\n[End Page 2]\nlittle grieviences.\nI hope to see Armant but have not heard from him for\nover a month. You wrote me he had left some time ago, but that\nhas been the last news I have had as to his whereabouts. It is\npossible he may pass by without my seeing him at all as it may\nhappen that he will not have the opportunity to look me up.\nI am not transferring to air intelligence nor do I have\nanything specific to do with air duty. However one of the most\nimportant functions is air work and as a result a great part of\nthis passes over my desk. You need not worry about my volunteering\nfor carrier work, nor will I go up in a plane, God Willing. The\nanswer to all your questions is NO. However men with designations\nof engineers, supply officers etc. besides myown branch are moved\noff very suddenly,as something else, and this of course may\nhappen to anyone. However I advise youto rely on Moon Face the\nGreat Chief, he will not be caught napping, he knows all, sees all\nand has the answers ready before the questions are asked.\nLife and time magazine have not arrived, it makes me\nfurious because I see other copies arriving forthe men every day.\nA bottle of absorbine Jr did come yesterday and sent me into\nroaors of laughter. You can buy it in every drugstore here.\nHowever I do want to thank you for the trouble and thought you went\nto an sending it to me and thank you very much.\nI went to the oesteopath yesterday and had a wonderful\ntime. The oesteopath turned out to be two women, sisters. They\nwere tiny and would both swing on one of my arms or legs together.\nI do not believe they weighed more than one hundred pounds\ntogether and I could not feel them. Finally one said to the\nother \"go and get a stool for me to stand on and work on his back.\"\n[End Page 3]\nThey trled this fora while and then decided that it would be\neasier if they worked on me on the floor. We were all laughing so\nmuch at the end that the fun of it cured me far more than the treat-\nment.\nHave to stop now and finish up some reports. With all\nmy love,\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 4]"
