      "value": "March 7, 1943\nGertie Darling,\nI have my little machine at home as I have new a\nbig machine in the office just like theprofessionaluse. As\na result I am knocking this lettter out with practiced fingers\nat a sp[e]ed that leaves the keys red hot and littleheat waves that\nshirnner in the lampflight. After reading the last few sentences\nit looks as if more than the heat waves are shimmering. Morris\nhas gone off to xxxxxxx the movies and I am in the apartment with\na boy we brougut home form the offce called Johnny Lee. He was\nat college with us, but I don't remember him. Anyway he came out\ntonjgut and we took him swinming and then cooked dinner here.\nWe a solutley refuse to go out anymore. Inflation has struck the\nisland with a bang andthe dinner we use to pay ninty cents\nfor is now one sixty and much less is served[ Two nights ago\nwe ate at the outrigger and I had a dab of vegetables, not a teas\npoonful, one tiny potatoe [A]nd not enough fish to bait a hook\nwith. One dollar and seven[t]y cents. Tonight we cooked a wonderful\ncan of chicken, three packages of biros eye green peas and some\nsweet potatoes and I am so full andsleepy that I have to do this\nletter by the touch system as otheriwse I could not write. My\nbig fat stomach is hanging over the key board, blotting it out\nlike a fat cloud. Our guest is in the living room playing the\nradio. We have become quite matter of fact about them and\nthe Sidney as a host you use to knowdoes note[x]ist anymore.\nI nm as bad as morris use to be at Medway an simply get up\nand leave the room -and lying down on my bed read or go to sleep.\nI know you will be ashame[d] of me and will wolrk like fury to\nget me back into shape to face society when we xxxx are together\nagain.\nI went swimming today and went out to where Morris was\nriding in on big waves. He would fall off and I would roar with\nlaughter until some big wave would knock me down to the bottom\nand fill my lungs with water. Then I would surface red eyed and\npuffing and struggle about a little until I could once more gain\nsufficent strenght to holler derise_ely at him as he teetered\nin mid[air]. The hawaiians are so marvellous. They are like \npanthers on their boards. Half crouched with their feet dire tly\nunder them they move back and forth like cats judgin[g] the wave\n[End Page 1]\nso that they neverlose it but always keep just a little below\nthe crest. Duke Kahanamoko was out in a little canoe and was\na marvellous sight. He isfifty four and has the mucxles of a man\nof twenty. Really marvellous looking person, with his dark skin\nbroad shoulders and black black hair, shooting ahead of the white\nfoam. Of course ashore he does not shine with the same bright\nlight, but that is neither here nor there.\nThe days are so much longer now that I know summer is\nhere. There is no other may to recognize its appearnace. There\nis no change in temperature, the tress do not became green\nflowers do not come out, but the sun shines in a cloudless sky now\nand every evening at five a great shaft of color, purple vi[o]llet, \nblue and gold climbs out of the va[l]lexys and stretches in a great\narc towards diamond head. A rainbow so gorgxious , so colorful,\nthat it seems unreal. Th n the pigeons begin to swoop towards\nthe ponds and [the] hot air lies motio[n]less like a blanket over the palms\nand habicus hedges that guard the sides of Kalkua avenue. The\nplace shakesitself witht he first breeze over the mountains and\nthe fronds in the plams beggn to rustle with that marvellous soun d\nthat lives thorughout the night,a hidden undertone to the soft\nwhisper of the tradex winds. The stars coast across the sky so\nquikly here. I was never concious of their movements before\nbut here theyr ace across , constellations sweeping up\nfrom the sea and arching across the deep blue of the heavens trailing\na soft silvery light. This evening the clearness of the air made\nthem especially distinct. They seemed an emanation of the sunsext\nIwish you were here with me dear so that I could put\nmy arm about your wai.__t and walk slowly down the alawaj watching\nthe stars dive into the can[a]l and lie floating on its surface,\nbobbing up and down with the little waves. I f you could feel the\nsoft wind in your face and hear the plms rustling you would forget\nhow tired you were and a the dreadful life of being apart\nwould be athing of the past, bit it will some day sweetheart, believe\n[me,] I know. How I know I cant tell you but I am absolutley certain we\nwill once more be togerter again and I will be able to hold you in\nmy arms. Then vhen I tell you that I love and adore you you will\nhave to believe it for I will be there to prove it, while with a \nletter there is nothing but a memory and black lines on white\npaper to express what only eyes and lips can really tell. You will\nsee darling , some day I will be with you again to tell you that\nyou are everything to me. Then I will kiss you [so] hard that you will\nbeg for mercy, and I will hug youwith such a great hug that you\nwont have any strength to anything so I will pick you up and carry\nyou up to our room and love you for ever and ever.\n.\nGoodbye darling, please let me know how your trip is\ncomming along and when you expect to leave. I am so thrilled\nby your ability and the offer of this wonderful job for you.\nYou are marvellous Gertie and I know will make a great succes of it.\nwith all my love. \nSidney\n[End Page 2]"
