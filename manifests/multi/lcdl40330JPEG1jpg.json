      "value": "Charlottesville Jan 28th 1862. My dear Sister It is a very long time I believe since we have exchanged letters directly and I think that in [illegible] the very pleasant interchange of thought and affection we commit an error almost amounting to a wrong. Seeing so little of each other as we do it is the more important to keep alive the kindness of love by that Constant \"giving and receiving\" which is the essential law, and now there is so much to write that can interest. Every thing around you the College the people of Columbia the unwritten and unprinted views of the war doings, incidents of family and friends -- all have so great a [illegible] for us, and we are quite lonely here in the land of strangers, for our work keeps us very much aloof from Mary's kindred, and at times sad and down hearted. It is truly a work of sacrifice, and unceasing toil, worry and difficulties. It is the [illegible] Hospital. [Sick?], death, and it is so refreshing to get on another track -- a letter from home comes in so pleasantly and breaks the monotonous [current?]. Our work here progresses favorably -- the fire only called out increased executions -- by dint of right long labor we saved all of our stores from stealage and the fire only Consumed 20 beds and broke some crockery and tables and chairs. Every thing is where it was a week ago, We have only lost 4 out of every 100 sick man. How comforting it is to the sick to be told when they come into Hospital that their chance for recovery are 96 out of 100! We have our difficulties [On top]: P.S. Bets letter just received -- quite a cheer to us! answer soon.[End Page 1] to contend with, chiefly with our Surgeons who are very much spoilt by the idea of a commission, and our ladies who will quarrel with each other. But though [brought?] in on all unpleasant occasions to settle these feminine incompatibilities, I am as yet uncommitted to any degree or quarrel myself. Essie Habersham works very hard, is somewhat self willed and unreliable but really works and is useful. The fire broke up her Dietary department and she is now keeping the house for us. Mrs Lesesne is a treasure every way. I have been quite unwell of late and indeed am now confined to my room by a severe cold in my head. Mary too is hors de combat for the same reason. Hers is in her throat and she has lost her voice for 2 days. Singleton and Rob have been also suffering [illegible] as I had to give up our nursery to the ladies who were burned out in the Monticello we had a time of it 4 sick in the same Room night and day. I hope to be out tomorrow however. Tell Mamma Jackson is quite sick -- He has not done a hands turn since he came on Was taken sick with vomiting shortly after arriving here and I put him with Nancy and Alec away from the Hospital. A cold succeeded with a threat of Pneumonia. Then he got well and was just getting about, when he was taken again with a bowel affliction and is still quite sick. Nancy is [with?] [him?] and the Dr. has seen [him?] every day for a month. I am uneasy but know that he has had every attention from black and white. I think he overeats himself[End Page 2] as far as I can see the future, I think it probably that my operations here will terminate in April. The Troops go out then and I cannot reenlist for the war, without pay. If I remain here until July I will lose my Summer salary also. By returning in April I will [illegible page is folded inward] April to July's salaries and still have the vacation to renew my work. I am willing to spend & be spent only not borrowed money. So I think I had better take the occasion of the expiration of our Carolina troop's term of service and come home. I think too that some consideration is due the Call to duty from the Trustees, of Course it will only enhance the pleasure of returning to come home to you all. It is a treat I long have wished for to be [illegible] closely and [illegible] with you all for the knitting of those family ties So necessary to happiness and I want the Children to grow up with the consciousness of loving and being loved by those I most love and whose examples and ways I most esteem. We wont drive [Hattie?] away if she is there. Mary and self[End Page 3] will take the lower story which we had last year, Mary says. Mamma must keep house and just consider her one of the children. It is a long way off to plan and God only knows the future but as we have been cooped up here for 3 days we have indulged a little in \"house and home\" building. I think God has blessed my work here to me every way, and I feel [illegible] anxious to be [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] and lusty for God and his Christ. But we are poor frail creatures and I know I am not what I should be as a zealous watch man on the tower, or light, a city on a hill. If I only could be as Papa was, and be sure that he was always right, His life of prayer, devotion, sacrifice glowing ardent zeal and love for God and souls are my constant thought and then I am at loss to know how much of this -- not the [illegible], or the spirit but the degree the mode -- was connected with that disastrous lack of self control. Now my dear sister I have reached the end of my paper and I can say it is good for us to write this freely & fully to one another, one of you girls said one day at home \"we all lacked feeling\". I think we rather lack its \"expression\". -- Love to all. Tell the boys to study hard and give no trouble. Yours truly Robbie.[End Page 4]"
