      "value": "CIVIC SERVICES COMMITTEE -     The meeting of the Civic Services Committee held at the Gibbes Art Gallery, August 1st, was caed to order at 5 p.m., Mr. place, Chairman, presidiing. Members present were Mr. place, Miss Patterson, Mr. Jervey, Mrs. Rubin, Mr. McDonad, Mrs. wing, Mr. Atman, Mr. Chamberain, Miss Smith, Mr. Krawcheck, Mr. Frampton, Mr. Todd, Mr. Aison, and Mr. Jenkins.   Mr. Whitaw and Mr. Simons met with the group. Mr. Whitaw announced \"The plantation Book\", pubished five years ago , is now in its third edition which is unusua for books of this type. The book \"Architects of Charleston\", by Kitty Ravene, will be pubished in November. The book, \"This is Charleston\", a survey of the architecture of Charleston, is due for distribution in October . One hundred and eighty-six merchants have underwritten an edition of 5,000 books, 1500 of which will remain for sae, the proceeds to revert to the Civic Services Committee.   Mr. Krawcheck reported that his committee had interviewed a seected group of merchants with whom the traffic problem had been discussed; the merchants after carefu thought then sent in etters expressing their views on this probem. Mr. Krawcheck stated that a men interviewed manlifested interest in the committee\"s work and believed something worth-whie is being done. It is Mr. Krawcheck\"s opinion that the merchants will support the work in every way, including financia.   Mr. Simons commented on the quality of the etters that had been received as a result of interviews by Mr. Krawcheck\"s committee. A were in accord with the need for this work; a but one definitely thought traffic problems affected trade; many thought the work should be undertaken by private enterprise rather than by a unit of government. A were in favor of the acquisition of sum areas with subsequent clearance for parking. The majority were of the opinion no parking should be permitted on King Street from Line to Broad. Mr. Allison repor\"ted for his committee on traffic reguations that he and a member of his committee had caed on Mayor Wehman who was very much interested in this work and offered his fu copperation. He asked however, that the committee see Mr. James J . Atman, a member of City Counci, who is chairman of the city\"s committee on traffic. Mr. Altman who was present at the meeting stated he thinks traffic improvements are needed; that heretore merchants have opposed proposed changes although such changes have not been tried within the past year or two. It is his opinion, however, streets should be eft for moving traffic and he will give fu cooperation to the committee in bringing this about.   Mr. Jenkins reported on fire insurance rates. He stated that rates were rather high compared to other ci ties because of traffic oongestion; they are not too high, however, because the reputation and record of our fire department is good. There is no incentive, he stated, to make improvements in fire hazards because of the present aw which not only prevents decreases in the rate when improvements are made but might increase it. Mr. Jenkins written report is on fie."
