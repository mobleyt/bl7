      "value": "May 17, 1944\nDear Gertie,\nWhat do you think[,]Armant has left. He refused to\nlike the place or take any interest in the work, only spoke of\ngoing to sea and said that his true love lay in the bounding\nwaves. But you cannot imagine who he has gone with and wanted\nto go with. None other than that drunken captain he was with\nin New Olreans that he complained about and said that he just\ncould not stand. You remember, because you made the classical\nremark that you thought that was a lot of Hoey and that Armant\nreally wanted to get drunk. Well anyway he is gone and we are\nonce more the two of us in this apartment. It is rather ludicriou\nbecause we bought the place in a way so that we three would have\na home to l[i]ve in together. Morris and I had planned how wonderfu\nl it would be to have the three brothers together and Morris\nworked so hard to get him out here. It was unbelievable his\npersistence[,] his constant dogging of captains etc to obtain\npermission for Armant to be transferrred and now after a short\ntime hardly longer that a sigh and a whistel he is gone.\nSomethi ng happened so funny the other evening.\nOne of our tennants is a woman married to a hard faced speechless\nman. they come and go without a word, stony faced and grim.\nWe had never even arouse[d] sufficent interest to wonder what they\ndid or were doing, but suddenly their life was thrown open to us\nlike a book and we realized the boredom that exi sted at least on\none side. At ten thirty we were awakened by the womens loud\nvoice somewhat strengthed by stonrg sdrink. She shrieked\n\"there you lie, am I bored. You do nothing, nothing, just lie\nthere.\" There was moments silince in which I presume he told\nher not to talk so [L]oud as she would awakened the landlords.\nThis brought forth a tirade \"those lieutenants, those NAVY\nlieutenants what have they ever done for me. What do I owe them\"\nThis was followed by a bronx cheer emitted with considerable\ngusto and a loud \"nothing\". Morris by this time had his chin\non the window sill and was gazing interestingly across the court\nyard. Armnt lay on his bed drinking It all in and giving\nencouragement in a low voice with \" you tell them fat lady\"\nAbsolutely he is not Gen[T]lemen, there you lie and he does nothing,\nit is a crying shame that is what it is.\"\nIn this midst of this familly scene a tom cat let out a wail\nand then another and another. In a short time there must have\nbeen twenty tom cats sitting outside tha apartment house lifting\ntheir voices up to the sky. The cause was a shell colored\npersian cat that inhabits one of our apartmnots and apparently\nwas irrestibly a tractive to a[L]l the male tom cats for blocks\naround. After a council of war we decided that we either had to\nkill the cat or get her a mate. By joint consent Armant and\nI decided to let Morris handle the si tuation, but he went to\n[End Page 1]\nsleep and nothing was done. For some reasen the aparmtnet dwell\ners who I cons[i]der very much like cliff dwellers have all come\nto swords points with one nother and they waylay Morris and\nI and compalin about one another. \"that old hag\" one will say.\nShe phoned me last night and said that I was making too much noi\nse. I never make a sound but she stays in her room and gets dru\nnk all the time.  Then the women who gets drunk all the time\ntelephones and say_s that the people below her are impossible,\nhave no thought for anyone but themselves and play their radio\nuntil the wee hours of the morning. It is very funny. I can\nsee how mad you would get, and how you would tell Rose to take\ncharge of the whole matter.\nI talked to a boy who had just co[M]e back from a leave in\nthe mainland and he said that it was uhbelievable. No one\nseemed to know there was a war going on exce[p]t for the fact they\nwanted the war to be over in a hurry. They were tired of ration_\ningand all the petty annoyances that goes with war. Knew that\nfighting was going on somehwere in the world but not quite sure\nwhere. Also he said that the girls absolutley fell over the m[e]n.\nHe would walk into a bar and there would be crowds of girls, but\nnice girls who would talk to him and after a while he would pick\none out and say you are my date for the evening and she would be\ndelighted. Sort of different from the days when a man would\ntry to pick a girl up and would be looked at as if he was the w\nwickedest thing in the world. He also said that the only\nrationing he noticed was gasoline. As far as food was concerend\nther[e] was alomost more than enough to eat. Drinks were to be had\neverywhere and night clubs were opened until the wee hours of the\nmorning. It all sounds pretty gay and festive to me. But then\nyou cannot blame people. You would not wan t them to sit in their\nhomes and moan about the poor boys fighting. They might just as\nwell have a good time and enjoy themselves because moping never\ndid anyone any good in the world. The only thing that I cannot\nunderstad are the strikes. They are beyond me because the\nworkers are really getting a good salary. The government\ngives Montgomery Ward Hell when they are not even manufacturing\nwar materials, but when the xxxxxxx foremen strike in the factory\nand hold up all the manufaturing of aeroplanes they do nothing.\nLook what they did with Lewis when he closed all the coal mines\nwith his stikes. Absolutely defied the government and employers.\nBroke the law at every turn, held up the war effort and caused\na great many deaths. They did nothing to him at all. But when\nMontgomery Ward stands on its own legal rights, really for the\nprotection of its workers the governemnt takes it over. Well\nWhat can you expect with that man biddle in their. Remember\nwhen we ment and had to have our meals with him. We thought he\nwas such a pompous Ass.\nGoodbye darling. I hope everything is going well with \nyou and that I will see you soon. With all my love.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
