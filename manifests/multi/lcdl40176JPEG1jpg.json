      "value": "Kean's Neck Apl 22nd 1837 My dear Catherine I saw my mother on Friday and upon consulting with her about the girls returning without any particular person in charge of them in the seabrook, she did not see any impropriety in it as Hannah also would be with them and the voyage would, if as usual, be only for the day. She was extremely kind in offering to send down to the Boat for them and for them staying with her. I will have cato besides and the carriage ready at the wharf and to bring them here on Saturday. I have so many reasons for not coming for them by land that it is not worth while mentioning them. Suffice it to say I could not come at this time. Bet is still with Bower and the Girls can go for her after being here a day or two. If it shall please the Lord and we are all safe in the 3rd week in May, in Beaufort, I will endeavor to come down and see you, but circumstances must direct then. I am truly thankful to my dear William and yourself for your kindness to Meta. Particularly as you have been so sick[End Page 1] yourself. I trust Meta will feel more and more, how much, and how often you both have performed the affectionate attentions of the kindest parents to her. She seems fully sensible in her letters to me, of the kindness she has had from you both. The Lord makes us all sensible of our duties to each other, and the many obligations we owe those around us. But, may he make us, in particular, mindful of how much gratitude we owe him, at all times, and in all places for the innumerable blessings continually showered down upon us. Kiss the little ones for me and give my love to all the rest. and believe me my dear Catherine yours with warmest affections Ed Barnwell[End Page 2] Beg Edward to send the ploughs and points as I last directed him. Eastman's ploughs and the point like the one sent in the bag to him when the cane [seed?] [went?].
