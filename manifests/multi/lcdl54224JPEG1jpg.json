      "value": "Cat Island Feby [February] 6 1862 My Dear Wife Buck has just come into our Camp at this late hour of the night and informed me that he starts home in the morning so I will drop you a line if only to let you know that I am well. Why did you not write to be by Buck? I expect you did not know he was comeing [coming]. I wrote you once by mail and once by Benj Cannon both of which Letters I hope reached you, and found you still improving in health. I am constantly uneasy about you sometimes I get so lowspirited that I am no use to myself nor any one else, then I conclude if you were bad off surely I would hear of it. If you get bad off do let me know it and I will come Home and see you. I have not yet been able to get any part of my pay yet I am out of money and I owe a Negro for Building my House and my Washing Bill is unpaid for the last month. Cant you make me some more envelopes and send them to me by the first chance you get. We are living exactly hard here. Our daily food is Rice and salt Beef boiled together. Crackers without salt and our drink is Sasafras [Sassafras] tea sweetened with molasses. It is rather hard but I suppose a boddy [body] can get used to it at least it looks like we will have the chance before we get anything else. Well I don't care I keep fat on it and am willing to submit to even worse than that if the good of the Country requires it. tell Isa and Ned to write to me or I won't promise to write again soon. The sickness in the Regiment is fearfully on the increase there has been an average of two Deaths per day for the last four days. We have about thirty Cases of measels [measles] only one dangerous Tom Allen he will die I must close and fix some plan for sleeping as I have company Your Husband who loves you John R Beaty"
