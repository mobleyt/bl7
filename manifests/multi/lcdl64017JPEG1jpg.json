      "value": "Charleston 18th Sept 1817 My dear Mother, I feel anxious to write to you as quickly as possible, as I know that you must be a little in the fidgets about sending Mrs. Griffen to town in Blythewood, after receiving my last letter, saying that I had determined to give her up, and was trying to procure another nurse. however let me beg you dear Mother not to allow these circumstances to distress you in the least, it was a little unfortunate to be sure, that you sent Mrs. G. as I had partly engaged another nurse, but I am in hopes she will be able to get another place, Mrs. G. is gone down to Sullivans Island to stay until I send for her, and I hope every thing will be quietly settled, and convince us in the end that every thing happens for the best, - it is indeed a great relief to me, as the idea of giving up my old nurse distressed me very much.- I was really glad to see some one who could tell me all about you, but Mrs. G. says she things you are distressing yourself a great deal [End Page 1] too much about me, I feel afraid that I have been the cause of your distress by writing such complaining letters, when in reality I have great cause for Thankfulness, and as the time draws near I feel more resigned to the idea of being separated from you. We have at last been so fortunate as to purchase a seamstress, who I am very much pleased with, I have had her but two days so that I am not yet a good judge of her work, but she appears to be extremely good temper'd and an excellent waiting maid, of all these qualities in a servant you know I stand very much in need and I have no doubt that it will give you great pleasure to hear of our good fortune in this respect.- I dare say you will be pleased to hear the particulars of the benevolent Society which I wrote you about the beginning of the Summer, and which has kept the Ladies of Charleston in a state of great agitation for several months,- on Monday last the business was settled, by Mrs. Mitchel being turned out of office, and Mrs. Dr. Keith made superintendant, Miss S. Drayton is still Secretary and Treasurer and [End Page 2] Miss Drayton the assistant Superintendant. whether the business will be as well conducted as formerly is yet to be determined.- I hear that Mrs. Finleys children have been very [page torn] not heard for [page torn] hope that they are better. Do beg Betsy if she still [page missing] book that she wrote me to get for [page missing] ago, to write again and tell me the name [page missing] Bythewood returns, as I destroyed the [page missing] entirely forgotten all about it. We are all quite well, I really wish you could see your little Grandsons, they look so perfectly well, and are such fine boys, I don't think William will ever come near them, and as to little Mary, tell Elizabeth when she sees my Two Sons she will be out of all patience with that bad little Girl of hers.-however I am glad to hear that she is nursing her still. I hope that Mary is better; do give my love to her and all the Girls and believe me dear Mother to be Your ever Affectionate Child Hetty B Heyward.--- [End Page 3] Mrs. Mary Barnwell. Beaufort. South Carolina. [End Page 4]"
