      "value": "November 30, 1939  David H. Stevens, Esq.  Rockefeller Foundation  49 West 49th Street  New York, N. Y.  Dear Mr. Stevens:  At your suggestion I have read \"Certain Hypotheses with regard to Movies and Radio\" by Geoffrey Gorer and was exremey interested not only in his subject but in his approach to it.  As I expained to you on November 17 the growth of the Carolina Art  Association in the past eight years has been phenomena, from an expenditure of about $2,500 in 1931 to approximatey $60,000 last season; membership in the same period from 6 fu members to 2,547. Much of our growth has been hap-hazard or brought about by our being opportunists. We have many ideas as to our future but I believe that it is essentia at this time to have facts on which to base our plans rather than surmise as to our place in the community. I have, of course, arrived at many concusions and believe  that a social society of Charleston will bear me out. However, our growth from now on should be carefully planned and not on surmises or personal concustions. As I said to you, we seem to resembe a sort of witch\"s brew or pot that bois over without any fire. I believe that a study of the city, its people and its institutions would answer many questions and furnish many facts which should be invauable to us in the future. If a trained man in this fied of study, such as Mr. Gorer, were made avaiable to us, or if you could send him here for this survey with a letter of introduction to me, I believe that his first report would indicate the need of a further and more compete report. Some social surveys have been made in Charleston but never from the viewpoint of the need for or potentialities of an art organization and the suggested report would be most valuable to me and my Board, and, I believe, to any student of American cities.  You will be interested to know that I discussed the need of an architectural survey with Mr. Keppe. He requested that I send him a memo at once.  Sincerely yours,  Robert N. S. Whitelaw, Director  rnsw;em"
