      "value": "January 1, 1946\nH a, Dreary Eyes,\nI bet if you had received this on the day it\nis being written you would not be able to see out of those\nred old embers that adorn your forehead. Last night I too\nmy guests, Laddie, Mary, Tom Eastman, John Lee, but left Landines \nguests behind nd went to old man Kittridges for dinner. Fat\nface Morris and his wife were there and we really had a time.\nTen martinis apeice and the a dinner that would sink a ship.\nThree or four kind of wines, brandy etc. We arose from the table \nat eleven, caught a few more drinks and then the ceremony of\nringing the new year in came about. Ben the son was sent into\nthe yard to ring the old slve bell that had remained quiet\nfor the three years during which he had been away. At twelve\noclock Mr Kittridge shot off a gun and Ben to keep I think\nfrom falling on his face seized the bell rope. He hung onto it\nfor awhile swaying hack and forth until some faithful retainer\nrescued him. Everyone then returned to the dinning room to\neat Hopping John. This is a rice dish with cowpeas and is\nsupposed to bring you very good luck. Afterwards more champagne\nand then into the car at three AM and headed for home. Just\nas we were about to turn into the Medway Road a drunken figure\nsignaled us to stop. It was Morris, his car had a puncture and\nhe wanted assistance. Can you beat that for luck , he had the\npuncture just where we had to slow down. Of course all the\ndrunks piled out of the car and started to change tires. You \nhave never seen a funnier picture, they would fall down , try\nand help one another up, or just quit and join thegroup that\nwas singing a litt e to one side.\nThis had been a cracy chirstmas week . I told\nyou about the furnace quiting. Well sir, we had stocked\nthe new deep freeze with meat etc. to last us the entire winter.\nFifty chickens, a dozen turkeys etc. Of course it stops\nworking Sunday, when no one can be found to repeiar it so\neverythi g is dragged out and we try to eat up an entire winters\nsupply in two days before it spoils. Then Laddie and his friend\ngo duck shooting. They are game hogs and both try to shoot\nthe same duck as it flies between their blinds before the other\ncan get it. The result, laddie gets the charge of shot in his\nface. Sent him to the doctor who said it had gone in so far\nhe advise him to leave it all in. Landine and Bo have been \nill in bed with the flu, but Landines friend came to the table\nor Christmas dinner andpromptly vomited on the table.\n[End Page 1]\nCertainly am sorry that you have become a WORRIER because\nthat is an awful t ing to be. If only you had liked Honolulu\nwe could all go back there because that is a place where I \nfound worry did not exist. On my return here I started to worry\nabout theplantation and the fact that the ceilings were falling\nand thepipes rusitng out and the rice banks breaking , besides\nthe cattle bogging down the dogs with distemper etc. but I\nthought what would the Fuhrer do, and immediately dvine\ninspiration came to me and said the Fuhrer would let someone\nelse do the worrying. Immediately I told Gertrude that I had\nbeen runni g this place for 15 years and now she would take it\nfor the first of her ifteen years. I'll say this for her it\ndoes not worry her at all, if a car has a punture she telephones\nto Charleston and tells t  m to send out a man to fix it,\nslightly expensive but saves lots of work.\nBubble Belly and I will give you warnings so you can take\nto the hills when we arrive, but we will follow you there so\nwhy run. Before I close let me tell you what Tom Eastman did\nto this very stuffy friend of his. They were comming from a\nparty in Baltimore and Tom had asked him to spend the night with\nhim. On the way home Tom xxx sto ped in front of a house and\nsaid this is a whore house lets go in. The friend said no\nI am a happyly married man, I will wait in the car. Tom goes in ,\nit is really his own house and he climbs into bed and sleeps\nthe sleep of the just. About eight in the morning the friend\nsitting outside in the car is tired of waiting and rings the \ndoorbell, the butler comes to the door and says \"sorry but\nMr Eastman cannot be disturbed.\" This sap waits in the car\nuntil about eleven when Tom emerges after having a good nights\nsleep and his breakfas and says \"no use going to my house it \nis too late lets go back to town.\" So off they go.\nSo long old man\n[End Page 2]"
