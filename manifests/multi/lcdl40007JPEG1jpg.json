      "value": "Wednesday Morning Sept. 11, 1839 My Dear William, It has pleased the Lord to take another of Robert's children unto himself. Little William died about an hour ago of the disease of which his Sister died, assuming precisely the same course, commencing in the throat & changing almost immediately into Croup. William had no fever at all until Monday night was hardly considered a sick child--that night his disease put in the Croup cough & he lived until six o'clock this morning, then he died, quite [End Page 1] easily. For him whose is now a little angel before the face of his Heavenly Father & cannot grieve but for his parents & feel most deeply. Here [illegible], but thanks be to God, [illegible] hope [illegible] what's better from [illegible] the witness of love attached to it \"for whom the Lord loveth, he also chasteneth.\" Have [illegible], which cannot look to any other force of consolation, than the business or the pleasure of the passing time. It seems strange that the only two deaths which should have occurred in Beaufort this summer, should have been these two children. But the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth! Hallelujah Holy, [illegible]. We thought[End Page 2] with fever is [illegible] & has attacked a good many persons, old & young. Before no case except these, have the patients been considered in danger. But these, it immediately fell in the windpipe & proved fatal. I'm writing to Robert still directly [Hole in MS], requesting a Bank of a letter that Cotesworth, to whose care they are sent, would forward them should Robert & his family have left that place. Remember me & give affect. to Catharine & your children & relatives. [illegible] & affect. Your brother Stephen Elliott Revd Wm H. Barnwell[End Page 3] Rev. S. Elliott Sr. Sept. 11th 1839, Informing me of Death of my brothers Little boy, Willie To/ Revd Wm H. Barnwell Charleston So. Carolina &lt;SOUTH CAROLINA SEP&gt; [End Page 4]"
