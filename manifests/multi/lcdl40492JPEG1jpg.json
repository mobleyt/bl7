      "value": "We stand today at the confluence of two streams - two streams of spiritual endeavor which, have been flowing separately in this city for over three quarters of a century. As these streams are now coalescing into one we wish to ask for God's blessing upon the union tlfciat more good be done for the upbuilding of His Kingdom than they could now do separately. We witness today not the stopping of either stream but the flowing on of both. It is really wonderful to think that old St. Peter's is rising again after all these years - some sixty-four - Phoenix like from her ashes, ready to begin again her active life of good works, \"To give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: and to guide our feet into the way of peace\". It was nearly a hundred years ago, in 1833 to be exact, that God put it into the hearts of some of his people to build another church in Charleston. There were then only two Episcopal Churches within the corporate limits of the City - St. Philip's and St. Michael's. St. Paul's was just beyond. Thus St. Peter's Church was built on Logan Street and soon began its short but useful career. One bearing a name of great distinction in the annals of both church and state was the first rector. For twenty years the Rev. William Hazzard Barnwell served until his health permitted him to work no longer. He was succeeded by three other clergymen in succession, the 1st being Rev. W. 0. Prentiss who gave so many years to the service of the Church in the Diocese. The church was destroyed in the great fire that swept across the [End Page 1] - 2- city from the Cooper to the Ashley River in December 1861. St. Peter's made a name for itself through its missionary spirit and set an example for the Diocese of what we may call non-parochialism. It did not allow its spiritual interests ever to be confined to its own four walls. Beyond its borders both near and far its influence was felt. It was in large measure due to the influence of this parish that Grace Church was established and the parish was noted for the support it gave to St. Rev. William J. Boone, the first Bishop of China. May we not hope that the new St. Peter's will cherish its inheritance in these regards with just as much fervor as it does the magnificent material gift that has come to it from the same source. We cannot but believe that it was the guiding hand and power of our Heavenly Father which acted through a group of men who faithfully continued their organization as the vestry of St. Peter's after the destruction of the church through a long period of years and who by an unsurpassed loyalty to their trust, made possible this continuation of the work of the old parish which we now witness. Let all honor be given to these men for what they did. While there were others to whom credit is also due, we cannot refrain on this occasion from calling the name of the late Hon. Joseph W. Barnwell to whose ability, care, and absolutely uncompensated service in this matter, the comsummation we now witness is so largely due. The new St. Peter's is charged with a heavy responsibility to conserve all that the old parish has so generously bequeathed to her of both a material and spiritual character. And now we turn to look at the other stream that is flowing in to mingle with this - old Christ Church. It comes with its story of persevering service, often in the face of great difficulty -[End Page 2] - 3 - holding up the banner of Christ in a portion of this community where for years there were no other churches. It is a story which reaches back to 1823 when Mrs. Sophia Frances Shepheard gave the tract of land on which these buildings are now being erected. It was, she stated, a thank offering to God for his numerous blessings to her. And now we thank God for putting the thought in her mind - an inspiration of God indeed for who then could have forseen the value of this site today. It was not however until 1854, through the activity of Rev. Edward Phillips and the generous interest of his brother, Col. John Phillips and others that old Christ Church was built. Rev. Mr. Phillips died before the work was completed and Rev. Mercier Green became rector in 1858. The work was interrupted by the war in 1863 but was resumed again under Mr. Green in 1872. Time would fail me this afternoon to recount in detail the story of Christ Church for the past fifty eight years. It was through the persevering services of men like Mr. Henry P. Archer and women like Mrs. Mary E. Sinkler that the work continued. Once not so long ago it seemed almost as if the church was located in the country and now this site is in the midst of a large population with the opportunity for an indefinitely enlarging work for Christ and his Kingdom. And now at this juncture in God's providence comes the other stream flowing in to add its strength and make possible a larger work for God. As the streams mingle old Christ Church is called upon to make a sacrifice - to give up its name. Suggestive of that sacrifice a woman makes when she marries a man/, This was no easy matter but sacrifice is the law of Christian life and we trust that this act will be taken by the members of the new named combined Church as a type of that self abnegation which is essential in doing God's work. It will indeed no longer be Christ Church but it still will be [End Page 3] - 4 - Christ's Church;and if we all, my brethren join hand in utter loyalty to Christ, putting aside all small and personal considerations we can make it more and more truly His Church. The laying of this Corner Stone is an event in the ecclesiastical history of the Church in this City and this Diocese. We hold this service in the confidence that in response to our prayers now offered God will bless this work. Our supreme prayer today is that as these two churchs are merged so the hearts of all the members of the new St. Peter's will be merged in love and they they will go forward into the new period with the Spirit of Christ in their hearts. It seems to me I can hear a Voice now saying, to us all, \"This have I done for you, what wilt thou do for me?\" A. S. Thomas Bishop of South Carolina October 21, 1930[End Page 4]"
