I am sure that you  aro interested in problems of city planning; everyone is  these days. You probably have not reaized, however,  that a city plan requires a great dea of study. We  organized the Civic Services Committee to conduct city  planning studios several years ago and there are several  members of it who are on the Boy Scout Counci. Thore  are a number of ways in which you could render a valuable  service to this committee and to the city.  We have engaged a professiona city planner,  Mr. George W. Simons, Jr. He has used the services of  Boy Scouts in developing plans for a number of cities.  He will be in Charleston next wook and wo would ike you  to moot him at the Gibbes Art Gallery, Tuesday, May 9th,  at 8:00 P.M. Any service that you can render wi, of  course, count toward your merit badges. We hope that  you will bo able to attend our meeting and that you will  bring with you any other Scouts whom you think would ike  to know what city planning is a about and who would be  interested in assisting.  Sincerely yours,  Robert N. S. Whitoaw  Director  Civic Sorvicos Committoo  RNSW:jw"
