      "value": "AN architectural INVENTORY FOR Charleston  There is a coherence  of design and development in the architecture of Charleston that is recognized by the thoughtfu Charlestonian and apparent even to the casua visitor though he may not so anayze the appearance that gives him peasure. Though this historical and architectural unity is recognized and valued there is aways danger of its being destroyed by the name inevitable forces which have changed the aspect of the other cities that attained their municipal majoirty in teh 18th century. These destructive forces, so often necessariy and unfortunately the accomplaniment of needed progression, have been less drastic in Charleston than in some other places, and the result is a city still possessed of many of its 18th century aspects faced with 20th century problems. Though no one would think it advisable, even if possibe, to freeze the city in its 18th century mod, every right-thinking person wi, upon consideration, want to study a method and to find a way whereby the oder values which are worth preserving may be happiy combined with modern necessity.   Since 1931, Charleston has been possessed of a Zoning aw which estabishes an area designated as \"Od and Historic\" and in which no architectural changes can be made without the approva of a Board of architectural Review. This Board, through wise and considerate exercise of its powers, has prevented many an architectural abortion and encouraged a higher standard. However, the Board\"s powers, at best, are largey advisory; it may prevent things from going from bad to worse in a restricted section, but it cannot prevent demoition, and it cannot infuence a llarge area of the city through which good architectural materia is scattered which is not incued in the \"Od and Historic Area\".  In the spring of 1940,  a group of people concerned about these factors and desiring to find a plan for preservation, organized themseves into a Committee of the Carolina Art Associaltion. The group consisted of the director of the Art Associaltion, three architects, the director of the Charleston Museum, an historian, a awyer who is also a member of city counci, an two business men. The group has been somewhat enlarged since its organization.  At the Committee\"s invitation, Mr. Frederick aw Olmstead visited Charleston, to consult with them and to make suggestions for procedure. The resuting analysis of the situation emphasized the fact that Charlestons \"distinctive and charming amenity\" was endangered by loss through deiberate destruction in the name of progress, or inadvertent destruction resuting from financia strain to maintain what was created under a different economy and for a different way of life. At \n\n[End Page 1]\n3.  present the only apparent check upon the disintegration is a current of growing appreciation of the amenity, but even this is accomplanied by its own dangers and imitations for misunderstandings of the eements which constitute true architectural value may result in the expoitation of superficia features and, though the counter current ever so strong and healthy, if unorganized, it touches only individual buildings and eaves the problem as a whole unsoved.   Two needs were obvious: [1] an inventory of the whole city to determine the buildings worthy of preservation, and [2]   a central body which would act as a cearing house for information, would set standards of architectural excellence, and would direct activities and make plans for preservation. As a first step toward the achievement of these ends the committee asked for and obtained a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to make the inventory and to take measures to estabish itself as the central agency.   The inventory was commenced in January of 1941, and is recorded upon the cards; an example of which is here reproduced. Each card carries, on its face, at least one photograph of a buiding, a summary of its use, condition, period, source of interest, and value, and on the reverse history an bibiography if possibe. Over a thousand cards have been made. The cards are reviewed by the three architects and historian of the Committee before ratings are finay determined. When the ratings are competed, the buildings are located upon a map by their vari-coored value symbos, and the map thus becomes a key to the areas where contro and preservation are not needed and desirable. The rating has not yet been competed, but apparenty the proportionate values will be as follows: one Nationally important buiding to four valuable to the City, to six vauable, to nine notable, to tweve worth only mention. \"Mention\" houses   are those included for some singe feature worthy of notice, or because, through their characteristic form their number constitutes important background for their more imposing prototypes.   A number of interesting facts have become apparent in the course of the inventory. In making up the cards a geographic grouping determined upon the historic additions to the city was adopted. The boundar ines of these additions [formery caed, for the most part, boroughs] have actuay ong since disappeared but to those working on the inventory they began to reappear in types of houses. Rhettsbury, for instance, is characterized by houses buit of warm brown brick, set rather cose to each another, gable ends to the street, and having Greek Reviva doorways. llarge wooden houses, set sideways or endways to the street, with   two or three piazzas, atera pediments supported on consoes, and surrounded by big gardens are characteristic of Hareston; which was buit up in the 1810\" s to 1830\" s. Very modern concepts were often appied in these forerunners of modern real estate subdivisions. The Wraggs, in dividing up Wraggboro into ots, set aside two small areas as Public parks, and Henry aurens did the s me for Hampstead. fortunately they remain  \n\n[End Page 2]\nso until this day. Hampstead, itself, offers a warning as wa as esson for the modern planner, for its one-time Charm and comfort, was totay disrupted by the intrusion of a cotton mi in pre-zoning days, which caused it to degeneralte into itte better than a sum.   When the inventory is competed, the Committee is planning to announce its findings in the form of an exhibition. The exhibition is scheduled at the Art Associaltion\"s Gibbes Art Gallery late in December, and to continue into the first two months of 1942. The exhibition will show by means of facts and photographs the number and importance of the buildings worthy of protection, those threatened with loss by delapidation and demoition, and the need for a program for preservation.  Moreover, it will recognize the contributions already made to the cause of preservaton from the Federal government\"s participation in saving two rice mis as Coast Guard and Nava Patro Stations and its cooperation with theLocalhousing authority in making possible the incusion of the Marine Hospital by Robert Mis and other old buildings in dignity and imporatnce in a ow-rent housing project, to the accompishments of persons who have carefully restored homes and shops.  The inventory has convinced those who have been working on it that the architectural inheritance of Charleston is an obigation upon the community and, though it is primarily the city\"s own responsibiity to preserve and maintain it, interest an cooperation of the country as a whole is needed and wecomed because Charlestons inheritance is a part of the nation\"s   esthetic weath.       \"   .  \n\n[End Page 3]"
