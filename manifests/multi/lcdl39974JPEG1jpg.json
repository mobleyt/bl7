      "value": "Laurel Bay. April 24th 1832. My dear Brother in Christ. The sorrow which I felt at finding that your failure to answer my letter was occasioned by the malady of your eyes, was turned into joy at perceiving from your evangelical letter, how little this light affliction was counted by you, compared with that exceeding weight of Glory which is prepared for you eternal in the Heavens. Oh my dear Day what a blessed thing it is to be a Christian! to know by the [pure?] word of God and to feel by sweet experience that all things are working together for our good. It is indeed a foretaste of joys to come-- and unable to give expression to the ravishing delight which we feel at beholding the Glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus. we can truly exclaim-- \"eye hath not seen. nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which God has prepared for those that love him\". And yet how slow of heart are we to believe all that God has promised, and how foolish to suffer ourselves to be bewitched by the vain and idle things of this our Pilgrimage. Really when I read with an eye of Faith and heart of Love. the Promises of God sealed as they are to us by the Hood of his only begotten Son. and then look at the lives of those around me who call themselves Christians, or at my own life; I cannot but [wonder?] at the unbelief which [End Page 1] makes us rely so much upon out own weakness, and so little upon the arm of Omnipotence which is ever stretched out to sustain us. Do Christians really believe that in Christ is a fulness of wisdom. Righteousness. Sanctification and Redemption and yet [illegible: shew?] forth so few of the fruits of Holiness in their lives? Do we truly believe that God is willing to give his Holy Spirit to those who as him, and yet we spend so much of our time without its divine [illegible]? Do we sincerely believe that we ought to do all things for the Glory of God and yet do we strive to do so little? Where are those now who count all things but [illegible] for the Glory of God? Where those who know nothing among men by Jesus Christ & him crucified? Where those who deny themselves daily and take up the Cross and follow Christ? Alas! Alas! how short do we all come of the Glory of God! If our love for Christ were tested by our observance of his commands. (and he has said, if ye love me keep my commandments). how very low is our love. How infinitely short does it come of his perfect [precept?]. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and all thy strength.\" Oh what would be our state, without an Infinitely Perfect Purety to fulfil for us the requirements of this Law-- and an Inifinitely meritorious High-Priest to atone for our countless transgressions, by the all sufficient Sacrifice of his own body upon the Cross. [End Page 2] And what shall we render to our God for all of these his benefits? Our poor fallen Nature has nothing to offer to a God who is of purer eyes than to behold Iniquity-- And when conscious of our utter helplessness we cast at the feet of our bleeding Saviour our hearts broken and contrite with the sense of their own sinfulness, we offer up to God the only sacrifice which he desires of us. Oh the unreachable riches of Christ! Well may Angels desire to look into these things. Well may the Redeemed in Glory sing Hallelujahs to the Lord that was slain! Let us watch them my dear friend. and pray that we too may join that bright and happy throng, through Eternity and that even through time we may by Faith & Hope enjoy foretastes of those [illegible: page torn. endless?] prefect pleasures. Let us \"fight the good fight\". [illegible: page torn. Let?] \"cast aside every weight & the sin that so easily [illegible: page torn] us. & run with patience the race that is set before us. looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith. And oh may the Holy Spirit without which we can neither will nor do any good thing so inspire and Sanctify our hearts as to make us \"burning and shining lights\" in the Church on Earth. To reign as Kings and High Priests with Christ in the General Assembly of the first-born in Heaven! I agree most cheerfully to both of your suggestions in that we write to each other regularly the first of every month. you of one & I of the next-- and that on the third Monday evening of every Month, we make our Litchfield friends the subject of our earnest prayers. Oh if God shall bless these supplications. (and wherefore should we doubt? [End Page 3] methinks with the eye of Faith I can even now see them all, at their respective homes singing Songs of Redeeming Love.). What rapture will it add to our joys in the day of the Lord Jesus to find that, in answer to our feeble sinful prayers, the free Grace of God drew them to the feet of bleeding Love. Oh let us wrestle with our God for this blessing upon our friends! The Redeemers Kingdom is spreading fast in our Land. Whites & Blacks, Bond & Free are daily brought by the Spirit of Adoption into the Glorious Liberty of the Sons of God. The hearts of Masters are turned in a wonderful degree to their slaves; and we are in the Neighbourhood striving to give them that Freedom which alone can make them happy-- Freedom from Sin & Hell by the blood a Crucified Saviour.-- God bless the work! I'm a shameful letter writer-- my papers finished, & not half said-- I would try your Red Ink-- but fear you will scarcely make out the black-- Pray for me, dear Day, & remember me a Christian love to your family' who I love for yours as well as for Christ sake-- Yours-- Wm. H. Barnwell To Edgar B. Day Esqr Catskill New YoRK Wm H. Barnwell April 24 1832 Copied Beaufort 2d May[End Page 4]"
