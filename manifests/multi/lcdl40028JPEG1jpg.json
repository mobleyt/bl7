      "value": "Lincolnton North Carolina June 26th. 1843-- Rev and dear Sir, I have to solicit your aid in behalf of the noblest cause that man can advocate-- the Church of God. I am conscious that my advocacy is feeble but Jehovah can accompany it with his blessing. May He dispose you to render me the aid which I seek.-- In 1838 when I & my family (members of the Ch. of England) fixed our residence here, my wife & self were the only communicants of the Ch in Lincoln & I could discover only four others who were favourably disposed towards Episcopacy. The painful truth now presented itself to my view, that in providing for my family \"the meat which perisheth\" I had cut them off from the [ordinancy?] of the Church. I could now no more meet my brother in the courts of the Lord's house. To one who ever felt it a delight to attend the services of the Sanctuary how sad did Each returning Sabbath now appear? There were here places of worship belonging to several denominations, but I would not, I dared not teach my children on whose heads the consecration waters of England's Ch., to frequent them. I knew that were I to lead these lambs into strange pastures, the church could justly change with an abandonment of the duty which I assumed when I brought my children to her holy altar to be dedicated to God, when I had the Churchman's mark imprinted on their foreheads & bestowed on one of them the sainted name of Reginold Heber. My duty was plainly worked out before me. I gathered my family about me Every Sunday and performed with them the time-honoured Services of our church. I also collected together a few children whom I instructed in the Ch. Catechism-- I called the attention of my neighbours to the Ch. I exhibited to them her pace and scriptural doctrines-- the rational, manly, fervent piety which her liturgy breathes-- the missionary Spirit of her Heber [End Page 1] her Martyn, & her Daniel Wilson-- the deep-toned piety of her Geo. Herbert, her Thos. Wilson, her White, and her beloved Dehon-- the great learning of her Usher, her Bramhall, her Butler and her Hooker-- and I forget not her noble band of martyrs who at the Stake and the block laid down their lives for Jesus' sake. The great head of the Ch. was pleased to bestow a blessing on the humble labors of a layman. In May 1841, I obtained the services of a Missionary from the Bishop and I was able to procure for his support on his arrival $104, his board and the keeping of his horse. He gives us only half of his time-- I also obtained here about $700 for building a Church Edifice. In June last the Bishop confirmed in our Church, Ten persons. The prosperity of our [illegible] awakened the hostility of the various sects around us, & we had to endure persecution, [aye?] Protestant persecution, and that of the most virulent & bitter character. The fact ought to be known to Episcopalians that a systematic and a most [unrelenting?] crusade is established in the interior of the country against their poor & feeble brethren. Had I time or space to mention the particulars I could wake up sorrow in your breast for men professing the christian name & calling themselves Xtn ministers. Their opposition has however been a good to us, \"surely the wrath of man shall praise thee.\" Our little Edifice is one of the most beautiful country churches in the Diocese. The Carpenter's work is completed and the laths are nailed on the walls, but we are unable to plaster or paint it-- We are also without a Bell and hangings for the pulpit and desk and every resource here is now exhausted from which I could obtain aid. In addition to the tax for building we had to support our minister who up to the present has received no aid from any Missionary society. In behalf of this poor persecuted little flock, I appeal for aid to my brethren of St Peter's through their good Rector. I have laboured earnestly for years to obtain in this place a resting place of the Ark of God-- Since the Church was organized I constantly[End Page 2] performed the duties of Ch. Warden, Lay Reader, Sunday School Superintendent, Sexton (including the menial Services connected with it which I performed with my own hands) and Chief Beggar. In the exercise of my \"gifts\" as a beggar I recently visited the Northern cities & several times travelled upwards of Twenty miles a day on foot. I used to be so weary that I could not sleep at night. Alas! all this labor was attended with very partial success, in consequence of the repeated calls made on the liberality of our people & the general depression of business-- I would entreat your kindly aid, my dear Sir, for this worthy object-- I ask it in the name of that Gad whose minister you are-- in the name of the Ch. at whose altar you serve,-- in the name of the Church of England one of whose scattered sons I am, and \"to which the Ch. in these States in indebted for a long continuance of nursing care.\" And on the day when \"He shall sit as a refiner of Silver,\" when every man will be judged according to his works, and when the best of men will stand in need of mercy, may it be your happy lot to hear from your approving Master, \"Well done good & faithful servant, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" I remain, Rev and dear Sir, Your friend and brother, in the best of bonds, Jeremiah W. Murphy Warden of St Luke's Ch. Lincolnton, N.C.[End Page 3] J.W. Murphy. July 3d 1843-- Read before congregation July 16h 1843-- And Augst 19h 1843-- Single-paid & [illegible], $50.-- Rev William H. Barnwell Rector of St Peter's Church Charleston South Carolina [End Page 4]"
