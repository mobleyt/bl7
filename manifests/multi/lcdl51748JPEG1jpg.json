      "value": "The two vessels which compose the double canoe are each about sixty or seventy feet long, and four or five broad in the middle and each end Terminates nearby in a point; but is put together exactly in the same manner; these having a rising in the middle round the open part, in the form of a long trough, which is made of boards, closely fitted together, and well secured to the body of the Vessel. Two such vessels are fashioned to, and parallel to each other, about six or seven feet asunder, by strong cross beams, secured by bandages to the upper part of the risings above mentioned. Over these beams and others, which are supported by stanchions fixed on the bodies of the canoes, is laid a boarded platform. All the parts which compose the double canoe, are made as strong and light as the nature of the work will admit, and may be immerged in water to the very platform, without being in danger of filling. Nor is it possible, under any circumstance whatever, for them to sink, so long as they hold together. Thus they are not only made vessels of burden, but fit for distant navigation. They are rigged with\n[End Page 1]\nOne mast, with steps upon the platform, and can easily be raised or taken down; and are sailed with a latteen sail, or triangular one, extended by a long yard, which is a little bent or crooked. The sail is made of mats, the rope they make use of is laid exactly like ours, and some of it is four or five inch. On the platform is built a little shed or hut which screens the crew from the sun and weather, and serves for other purposes. The way into the hold of the canoe is from off the platform, down a sort of uncovered hatchway, in which they stand to bail out the Water. I think these vessels are navigated either and foremost, and that, in changing tacks, they have only occasion to shift or jib round the sail; but of this I was not certain.  \n[End Page 2]\nDouble Boat of Friendly Isles from Captain Cook's Voyage\n[End Page 3]"
