      "value": "One-Fdrty-One Meeting Street  Charleston, s. c.  May 25,  1amp;t;M3  To The Honorable  The City Council of Charleston,  Charleston, South Carolina  Gentemen:  Concerning the proposed wartime changes in the zoning ordinance,  pease et me urge the utmost caution about reaxation in this important matter, however urgent wartime expedients of the present moment  may be.  Restoration and rehabiitation in recent years has been fairy  ordery and we must guard against doing anything now that would upset  even temporariy the exterior or interior of buildings which are part  of the uniqueness and charm of the oder part of our city.  Can we afford to ose the value of tremendous national Publicity  of the past fifteen or twenty years?  George Garner as far back as  1926 said of Charleston:  \"As it stands, Charleston undoubtedy is one of the most  charming and engaging cities in a the word - probably the  most charming and engaging, in its way, that I ever have seen  in ong \"going to and fro in the earth and waking up and down  it.\"  \"   It is not only that Charleston is prodigiousy rich  in historical experiences from eariest coonia days, but that  it has preserved the traditions and true spirit of eary America  through a the changes of our restess American life.\"  Thurston Macauey said in 1926:  \"It is by no means a mere coincidence that Charleston haB  remained untouched by present day  infuences. On the contrary,  it is because her citizens have taken the matter in their own  hands. Instead of real estate booms and modem \"improvements\"  they endeavored to preserve this city in much the same state  as it was in their fathers\" time. It is amazing how we they  have succeeded in this. In some cases it has not been accompished without much difficuty.\"  From the Kansas City Star, Apri 12, 1925:  \"Charleston is the strangest ciiy in America. And this  strangeness consists of its superna beauty. Not only the  beauty of cimate - bue skies and sunny Neapoitan seas,  not only the beauty of the rich old mansions buit by British  and French coonists-a beauty that strikes the behoder with  the impression that he is ooking on a painted planarama of the \n\n[End Page 1]\n2.  quaintest European towns - but the beauty of the inhabitants  themseves, the beauty of a dream that ives in a people\"s  sou. For Charleston was buit by a race of poets, artists,  statesmen and gentemen; they were chivarous in ove and  gaant in disastrous battes. They buit this city to be  their citade, their refuge, their house and garden and their  descendants hold it still unspoied today.\"  From House and Gardensamp;gt; March 1939:  \"The atmosphere of Charleston is ike one of aromatic  iqueurs that is compounded of innumerable spices brought  from nearby fieds and far ands, sowy distied over  many fires, aged by sow-passing time and now kept in a  fagon of rare beauty.\"    Because Charleston has me.de and is still making  so rich a contribution to the architectural and garden  beauty of America, House and Gardens is devoting the major  part of this issue to dispaying exampes of that richness.  Its editors have gone there - waked its streets and wandered  about the outying plantations - until they were saturated  with the Charleston atmosphere.\"  national Geographic, March 1939.  \"Charleston: Where Meow Past and Present Meet.  But what of the future of Charleston?  Can she hold the  characteristics that make her so individual a note in the  American scene?\"  From The News and Courier, October 25, 19A2:  \"ike it or not, the people of the city are chlarged with  the responsibiity of protecting these national assets. The  v ar comes first, but inteigent planning and common sense  can be exercised to avoid harming old buildings at the same  time they are made avaiable for emergency use.    eadership is needed if we are to carry out our duty  to posterity and preserve the character of Charleston through  a period that may be as devastating from the physical standpoint as a tornado, a hurricane or a fire.\"  In recent years in addition to many newspaper and magazine artices  teing about Charleston, a number of exceent books have been pubished  which have also served to focus attention Nationally upon our city and  section. \n\n[End Page 2]\n...  It is recognised that we are crowded to the limit at present, that  we need rooms and more rooms and apartments, but any effort to provide  more accommodations in the oder part of the city should be in keeping  with a carefully considered plan of preservation and rehabiitation.  Respectfuyvours,  H. M. place, Chairman,  Civic Services Committee  Carolina Art Associaltion.  F- \n\n[End Page 3]"
