How are the Happy Families coming along-- any\nthroats been cut yet ? I sure would like to see thatm household in\noperation. Perhaps I'll have the chance as I may have to come to New\nYork sometime this summer to arrange banking credit for my new firm.\nSure was sorry to hear about your sacroiliac Sid and trust it\nis fixed up by now-if not , be sure and come down here and let my\nbuddy Ruffian Walton work on you. I hope nothing inteferes with your\nplans of coming down here the early part of July after you finish the \nsightseeing trip to the Fuhrers movies. Incidentally , Morris, when\nOlive and I drove here from Kafrums graduation we went by way of Landis\nand Kannapolis so that I could show her those fine Movie houses. We\ntried to spend the night in Kannapolis so that we could attend the\nmovie [ free of course! ] but thats a mighty inhospitable town as they\ndont have a hotel or a tourist camp or anything. Guess Ole Man Cannon\njust dont like strangers!\nOlive is all set for you whenver you want to come. Just give\nus a few days warning so that we can put the gumbo pot on to boil.\nBeulah is in the hospital at present with a tumor but we have another\n\"jewel\" named Lily who worked about thirty years for Dr Jeff Miller\nand she claims to be the Worlds Champ at Gumbo. We will see ! The\nhickea is all in place on the downstaris porch and in fact I have been\nsleeping on it recently while waiting for the air-conditioning units\nupstairs to get repaired. There is plenty of room on it for all three\nof us to sleep-- women included! Also the crab and shrimp season is\njust right now and plenty good food to be had at the lakefront. Fif \nand May are due back here Monday so Olive and I are planning to take\nthem and our offspring to the Lakefron Monday night and get full of\nbeer and shrimp while hearing from them all the latest news re the\nBiddles and you.\nMany thanks Sid for your letter of June 14 wishing me Happy\nBirthday and also thank you Fuhrer for your wire of congratulations.\nIncidentally you will be glad to know that this year I celebrated it\nconsiderably quieter than last year when you were here and my colored\nbuddy Moody and I got pie-eyed . This year I was right in the midst\nof some horse-trading with my boss over the new firm and I couldnt\nafford to get drunk. In fact we finally closed the deal on my birthday.\nI got just about everything I could possibly expect out of\nhim--in fact a lot more than I ever thought I would. We intend to\nstart the new Corporation on August 1 st. We will incorporate for\n$100,000 but will only put up half this at the start and the balance\nwill be put up at some later date provided it is needed. Since I am\na 50[percent] owner , I will only need $25,000 on August 1 st. Sid , you said\nyou had this amount available now so you can turn it over to me an time\nconvenient to you between now and August 1 st. How about doing it when\nyou come down here in July ? We could then draw up the necessary notes\n[Stationary footer]\n[End Page 1]\n[Stationary heading]\nOTIS McALLISTER CO., LETD.\nGREEN COFFEE BROKERS\nand I will arrange some kind of collateral, either life insurance or\nmortagage on my house or whatever you prefer. I myself would rather\ntake out a new life insurance policy in your favor so as not to disturb\nmy present life insurance plan in favor of Olive and the children.\nHowever in the event I'm not able to pass a medical exam for new life\ninsurance , I can transfer some of my present policies to you as have\na total of around $80,000 with a present cash surrender value of about\n$20,000. I dont want to apply right now for a new policy as am still\ngoing to the Doc about my amoebas. He expect to have a vaccine ready\nin the next week that has been made from a culture of my crap and he\nhopes it will fix me up, So I want to wait on that so that when I apply\nfor a life insurance policy I can show a letter from the Doc saying that\nI'm cured. By the time you get here in July I hope this will all be\nstraightened out.\nEnclosed is copy of letter I have written Johnson-- Ye Boss.\nFrom it you will note that I'm having our lawyers draw up various\npapers covering Articles of Incorporation etc. These should be ready\nin a few days and I'll send you a copy if you like.\nYou will also note that I have hired a financial man. I had\nhoped to get Cummings who also used to be with me at Zander and who is\nthe one that you and I talked to Sid when you were here in April and he\nis the one Morris that sent you the bill for $15 last year but you\nthought it was for $150 ! He was all set to come with me at $8,000.\nsalary plus bonus but when he went to his present employers they made\nhim a n offer of $8,000 plus bonus and in addition made him manager of\ntheir New Orleans office. I couldnt top that , so he is staying there\nand instead I have gotten-another of my previous Zander \"boys\" , Martin\nDoody to come. He isnt as good as Cummings but he is okay and I think\nhe will develop. I think we now have a pretty good little organization.\nI figure our yearly overhead should come to about $50,000 at\nthe most. My arrangement for the new firm is that we receive 25 ¢ per\nbag on all coffees sold by the Otis organizations in our \"Southern\"\nterritory. In the past twelve months, even though we were xxxxxxx\nhampered by OPA restriction up to Oct 17 th 1946, and by being a new\nfirm here , we sold over 150,000 bags in this Southern territory. At\n25 ¢ a bag that would have figured $7,500. I surely think we can this\nwell or better this coming year, so that this brokerage alone will just\nabout cover our overhead. In addition, the new firm has the right to\nsell its own coffee anywhere in the USA---not just in the Southern part--\nwith a few restrictions. These restrictions are not bad at all and they\nwere the things that I was arguing with Johnson about and I think I got\nmy way about 99 [percent]. So, we should surely be able to make money on the\ncoffees owned by the New Orleans firm, and of course I have free rein\nto buy my coffees from anyone I want, to sell \"options\" on the New York\nCoffee Exchange, take any \"position\" I want etc etc.\nThe only drawback to the entire thing of course is that I\nhave Johnson as a 50 $ partner but I am Pres and Gen Manager and he has\n[Stationary footer]\n[End Page 2]\n[Stationary heading]\nOTIS McALLISTER CO., LTD.\nGREEN COFFEE BROKERS\nPage 3\npromised not to bother me until we have completed a years business.\nIf we dont show a profit then he has the right to raise all the Merry\nHell he wants.' If we find out that we cant get along with each\nother we will part company after year or so and with this in mind\nI'm having the lawyers draw up an agreement saying just how we will\ndo this , so that when the time comes xxxxxx we will have a basis to\nbuy or sell on. Also in case of his death or mine, our heirs will be\nprotected.\nMeantime , this arrangement gives me the safest way that I can\nthink of for once again actually running my own business. I'll be\ndoing everything that I would if I had instead gone into biz for\nmyself alone, and I have the very great advantage of having all the\nOtis McAllister coffees here inNew Orleans at my disposal to sell on\na 25 ¢ per bag broker ge with absolutely no risk on my part.\nAll in all, there is no doubt that the advantages in the deal\nfar offset the disadvantage of having him as a 50[percent] partner. After a few \nyears, after I have gotten well entrenched, there is nothing to stop\nme from pulling out and starting my own concern and by then I think\nthat I can take with me some of our accounts in Brazil etc. When that\ntime comes then I'll need more money to finance with as am sure my own\nname wont get as big a crdit line with the banks as the Otis name does.\nThey get about ten to one-- that is for every $100,000 of their net\nworth, the banks give them a line of credit for a million bucks. On my\nown name I would be lucky to get 4 to 1-- it would probably be 3 to 1.\nThat is why we will only be putting up a total of $50,000 on August l st\nbecause with Johnson[ same as Otis McAllister] associated with the new\nfirm, the banks will probably give us a half million line of credit\nwhich should be more than enough at least for the first year or so.\nWhen the time comes that I think it wise to pull out for myself\nand I need more dough, I will come yelplng to both of you per my usual\ncustom, but let us hope that in the meantime I will have made some\ndough out of this present arrangement andHAVE SAVED IT , and wont have\nto nick you two for too dam much! Needless to say I sure do thank you\nboth for all you have done so far, as without the knowledge that you\nwere willing to back me I could not have afforded to get as \"tough\" as\nI have with Johnson. With your help I have been able to beat him at\nthis little game of Poker-- at least I THINK I have---mebbe the future\nwill prove otherwise but I think not. So long guys, sure am looking\nforward to your visit so dont dlssapoint us \nArma Arma\n[Stationary footer]"
