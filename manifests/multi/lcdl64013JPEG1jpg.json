      "value": "Combahee 5th Jan. 1817 Dear Mother From a variety of circumstances I have not been able to attend to your little commissions as I wished. The hogs have been difficult, and I may almost say impossible to procure. --- Three which Old Harry thought would answer, have been bought from Capt. [Dert?], at a very high rate, say 8 dollars per hundred, or ten per head.--- These I think quite too small, but the great epicure W. Gibbons says- small hogs for [san?] However we have been induced to stop here.- As I prepare leaving this for Charleston tomorrow morning, I have directed to be put on board your boat, a barrel of whole rice, and two barrels of small rice; [one of the latter for Edward,] and as much flour as your barrels would conveniently contain, which I hope you will receive in good order.- We have been somewhat uneasy about your boat on account of the high wind [End Page 1] on Friday night; the day on which you expected them to set off.- They ought to be here at this time; but we have not heard of them.--- I am Dear Mother Yrs. Affectionately N. Heyward Junr. N.B. I have been to see my new cousin at the Eu [?] who is beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Hetty says I am in love.-- [End Page 2] Mrs. Mary Barnwell Beaufort [End Page 3]"
