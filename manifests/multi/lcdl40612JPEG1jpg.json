      "value": "Beaufort October 3d, 1834 I received your very acceptable letter yesterday my dear Anna, & would have waited three weeks before I replied to it, had I not a duty to perform, which can only be discharged through the medium of a letter. I beg therefore that you will consider this epistle rather as a [quieter?] to conscience, than as a voluntary tribute of affection. I tell you this, that you may not pronounce me \"intrusive.\" For I am afraid you will think me incorrigible, if after all the [broad?] hints you have given me, that you are not inclined to keep up a very regular correspondence, I should still persist in troubling you with my calls. I said I had a duty to perform. And I think you will agree with me, Miss Wilkinson, when I say, that the formation of a friendship implies an intention of the parties concerned to hold confidential intercourse with each other, and that therefore it would be an infringement of the compact, did one of the said parties withhold from the other, any communication which had been previously imported to 10 or 12 dear friends. The infringement of a compact implies a violation of duty. And it is in order to escape the smiting of conscience, that I now, at the unseasonable hour of midnight, pay you a new hope visit. The communication I have to make to you tonight, has reference to that strange mixture of \"earth's mould,\" known sometimes as Emma Elliot, though quite as often[End Page 1] as Lady [Timbleston?]. Having arrived as she thinks, at the age of discretion, having come to the conclusion that single blessedness is no blessedness, and having moreover, secured the \"faultless monster,\" she has given her heart & promised her hand to the same said monster; thus excluding herself from our sisterhood. This engagement was not entered upon rashly, so my lady says, and has given great satisfaction to all of the young gentleman's friends. We all like John B. very much, & I know of the young man that I would as willing for Emma to marry, if he was religious. But I think she places herself in a very trying situation when she chooses as the guide of her youth, one, who is not himself possessed of the light of the gospel, 'as a lamp to his feet.' He has however one of the finest natural dispositions I know of & with high principles & good moral character I think her prospects of happiness very fair. All of his immediate friends are very pious. And we must only hope that they will have a happy influence over him. Emma says, I must give her love to both Sarah & yourself, and tell you, that wherever & whenever the wedding takes place, she will surely expect you to be there. Her present arrangement is, to conclude matters in The Spring. William & Mary are expected in Savannah in a week or two. We were quite astonished to hear that Mary was coming down, and quite pleased to learn the why of the wherefore. Your penetration must suggest the reason to you--she[End Page 2] will spend the winter in Savannah with her family. Of course this arrangement will prevent my going to Clarkesville this winter, and though, when I do go, it will be from choice, I need not tell you, t'was no disappointment to me to hear that circumstances would oblige me to postpone my removal until the spring. William will bring Mary down, & return to the upper country in November, & I suppose come down again in the course of the winter. He has purchased a very pretty place, a few miles from my Uncle's, (Mr. Richard Habersham's) settlement. We expect to spend the winter in Columbia & are anxious to go up at once, on my Brother's account; but are quite at a loss how to get there. There are no regular roads running between Savannah & Charleston now, & after we do get to Charleston, we know of an opportunity [to?] Columbia, & it would be impossible for three [illegible] damsels, to travel by stage & said [illegible] without [illegible]. If any of you hear of anybody going up, could you not let us know if it? You will think, I have a troublesome conscience that would not let me stop at the end of the first page. But the fact is, I went writing on, without remembering how matters stood between us. Before I trespass any longer, I will tell you goodnight; only assuming you, that I will not put you to as much trouble to check my writing propensities, as you gave us to get you out of our room, the night that all \"hands went to work\" at New Hope--with love to your mother & sister, believe me respectfully yours P.G.E. So sleepy! [End Page 3] Do say to Miss Maria that I will write to her in a day or two--give my love to all my friends & excuse the liberty I take in adding a P.S.-- We have our subscription to the Club, ready to pay at any time. I was waiting until I passed through Charleston to give it to Mrs. Gibbes, but if she prefers, I can send it by letter, though I rather think I will see her almost as soon as she would receive the letter. Miss Anna B. Wilkinson Charleston So. Ca. Care of D. Wilkinson [End Page 4]"
