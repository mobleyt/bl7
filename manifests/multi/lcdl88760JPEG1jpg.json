  "description": "This is the first page of a letter written to \"William\" from Elias L. Rivers on April 29, 1895, in order to \"preserve\" a memory. In the letter, Rivers recalls the meeting of 14 men who were from James Island and that had served in the Civil War at \"William's\" home on March 27, 1895. Rivers lists the men's names and where they were living at the time. The men at the meeting included: Constant H. Rivers, E.L. Rivers, Jenkins Holmes, J.F. Lawton, J.H. Freer, W.G. Hinson, Dr. Robert Lebby, Dr. W.B. Seabrook, Dr. b.M. Lebby, W.A. Clark, W.B. Minott, Edward T. Legare, R.E. Mellichamp, Chas. H. Rivers. Mr. Rivers recalls that one man had not been to James Island since 1854 and was shocked at all of the changes he encountered upon arrival in 1895. The bottom of this page states that the group had a dinner and were joined by Mr. J.T. Dill, Robert Bee, and S.L. Hinson.",
