      "value": "Madame Baptiste Ursuline Convent Columbia Jan 16th 1858 1859 My Dearest Brother Hoping that you are safe at home again, and well, and judging from the contents of the Miscellany that your accounts are pretty square, I will trouble you with some of ours. I have opened the box of books and am somewhat disappointed with Mr. Murphy?. I will write enclosing a check to him for them, and probably let him know that I did not wish some of the books which he has sent, and wished another edition of some of what he did-But do not fear that I will offend him. Shall I offer to return the catechisms of history which he has sent me a great quantity of, instead of Religious Catechisms? I have this morning recd a very pleasing letter from Miss Ryan, who wrote Along the side: been made the repository of such a treasure-Sister Augustine, whose ? are as good as usual will write one of her agreeable ?, which I hope will amuse you. I enclose a picture, which I promised when in Baltimore I would give you, as the kind brother assured me that those who carry it will be preserved from all misfortunes-I have had it in my prayer book ever since. What news about the ? and islands? I hope Sister illegible was very illegible. Please present our ? to the Revd Clergy, especially illegible and Father Sullivan Pray for your own Sister Ellen Sister Baptiste [End Page 1] that she will be in Columbia the first or second week in February and should anything illegible to prevent, she will write and let us know. Thanks to you Lord and the Blessed Lady, we seem to be getting on very well indeed. We will now start our \"Circulating Library\" and hope maintain the protection of our Blessed Mother to ? as members, some of the most intelligent of the community here. Yesterday we had a visit from Mrs. Thomas Taylor, and her sister Miss Eleanor, a maiden Lady, with whom I was much pleased. We are also anxious to start at once our Society of the \"Sodality of the B Veil\" for the Ladies of the Congregation, but find in the manual for which we sent, no rules of any importance-seeing in the Miscellany of today, an article on \"the Children of Mary\" I though perhaps you would have the kindness to give me its rules, manner of proceedings etc. since it is adapted to persons in the world and would state them better than any we could give. Please send me this information as soon as convenient as Mrs. illegible has asked me about it several times and I think it might do some good to the Ladies of the [End Page 2] congregation. John and his family are quite well (and he presented me with a very nice pair of alabaster candlesticks, which we use on our communion table. I think he was ashamed of his manner that evening and I suppose you spoke to him-of course I made no further allusion to it he is on his best behavior at present. I had quite a long talk with \"the Old Doctor\" and trust I may be instrumental in removing any uncharitable that may exist between them-this is entre nous-for John would be out and out vexed with me, if he knew it, so we mutually requested that our conversation should be confidential of course that does not exclude you, who are my Superior, Bishop, Brother, and spiritual Father so when you come, I will tell you what we said. Revd Father Joseph has gone, I am told, to Greenville and will be away for a month-I hope this is not the case-for he may go as much as he likes (which I think is not at all) for a week at a time-but I do not like his being away on our confession day-We are not willing to consider it all in the family and go to the other Brothers-but would be glad that he was always convenient [End Page 3] for that duty, both for ourselves and our pupils. At the same time, I am afraid of paining the others by showing too decided a preference, or of spoiling the \" little Padre\" a word from you perhaps would do better-what do you think-I would in a moment write to him to that effect, taking it all on myself and County, if you think it would be judicious. I have had the painful duty to perform this week of communicating to Miss Griffin the sad intelligence of her brother William's death-poor child, she has suffered very much. Revd Father OConnell sent me a letter which they had read, and begged me to mention its contents, I did so, and wrote to Mrs. Griffin at once. Mrs. illegible told me yesterday that if Bernard would get down powders from Adams Springs in Virginia, and take this regularly, he would no doubt find great relief, and than next spring, if he would go to the Sulphur Springs VA he might like Col illegible, be restored to health. I have not heard from home or any of the family since I saw you and I write very seldom myself to any one, except when obliged. We are all DG well and happy, and are thinking of getting up a little ceremony to honor the venerable relic which you brought us, and in gratitude for our Convent having [End Page 4]"
