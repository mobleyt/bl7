      "value": "Haines City, Fa.  Box 32,  February 10, 1940.  Dear Mr. Whitelaw:  To avoid deaying beyond Monday morning the  deivery of suggestions on the basis of which you can  discuss,with Messrs. Howes, Stoney and Simons in particuar, detaied arrangements for the proposed \"Inventory\", so as to start preparation of the necessary mechanical equipment etc., I encose a rather haf-  baked memorandum on that subject.  I have not attempted to draft the form of  record cards.  you can perfectly we do that with  their advice, adding or subtracting items for which  spaces should be provided on the cards.  My guess is  that the cards might as we be of standard correspondence sheet size, leaving plenty of room for suppementary notes if desired and permitting tin assemby  in the same fie as the cards, if desired, of folders  containing pubished or unpubished data about any of  the units isted on the cards.  It might be we to  leave space at the top of each card for a Line of numbers or symbos referring to certain critica items  of information [to be seected ater] so that movable  \"tabs\" could be affixed to the upper edges of the cards  for ready visua reference to particuar classes of  of Information.  As to fied maps, probably the photostats  you had made of the City Engineer\"s map at about 300\"  to the inch would serve for \"district maps\", but it  would probably be convenient for the observers to carry  along an Insurance Atas\" showing lots and buildings  approximatey on a llarger scae, just for reference purposes.  And it might be found worth while for a cerica assistant, ater on, to make penci tracings from  the insurance atas  [or possiby small photostats]  showing the size and shape of ot and buildings of each  unit isted in its reation to adjacent properties.  When the whole city has been given the \"once  over\", and the most essentia data about the isted units  is on cards,with pencied numbers on a singe-sheet map  of the city, a system of symbos can be worked out for  entry on a sufficiently large-scae city map to show  graphicay the distribution of the units according to  any cassification which then seems expedient.  Sincerely yours,"
