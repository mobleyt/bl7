      "value": "52\nJanuary 20,1943\nGertie Darling,\nToday I received everything in the world\nfrom you. A wonderful shaving set with soap, afterlotion,\nandpo[w]der in a most attractive box. A book by fressie Oeschener\nand an V mail letter of January 11,. Youasked me to let\nyouknow whether the V mail was fast er than your letter 55.\nLetter 55 beat the V mail by four days. I think you are\nunder some misunderstanding about the air mail as far as\nI know we are still sending and receiving air mail. I know\nthat everyones experience with V mail is that it si anywhere\nfrom four to ten days latter than [air] mail.\nI am so sorry to he r that your boss is going\nacross. Surely you should be able to work something with\nhim that would get you across also so that you may share in\nthe excitement of what is happening in Europe. Is he taking\nanyone with him. You know asking never hurt and it might\nmean the difference between going and staying in the States.\nYour letter 55 sounds as if you are really fed\nup with the whole business and want to do something else.\nIt is so hard for me to advise youfrom hear. I know\nsometimes when everything looks blackest one gets the breaks.\nIf you stop just short of the line you can never win. Against\nthat is the fact that you can be stuck in a job that will\ndrive you nuts. Without knowing the facts and seeing what your\nchances are in something else I am unable to tell youwhat\nto do. Certainlyif you start in a new project you will have\nthe same number of dreary months to work up to a position\nequallying your present one. At times I think I will go nuts\nhere doing the same thing everyday. Ordering Paper clips,\nstapling papers, hearing ever ones complaints and telling\nthem I cannot recomment them for premotion. There is no future\nin it, but then we must not expect a fut[u]re in the navy or in\nstrategic services because neither of us have any intention of\nremaining in this type of work. All we can do is try and\ndo our present jobs with the greatest efficeincy possible and\nthus help the war effort. Some people arelucky as hell ,they\nare travelling all over the world and seeing interesting\npeople , but you must remember we had twelve years of a life\nthat was almost mythical. Travel, shooting, tennis in palm\nbeach, swimming on the Riviera etc. and there must be a certain\namount of bad with the good that we will accept without to\nmuch compalaining. There is another point about your \nremaining where you are which you may or may not consider\nimportant, that is Bo. We have seen what Landine has grown up\nto be. Maybe she was destined to be that way, but I do believe\n[End Page 1]\nthat the lonely hotel life of nurses , boarding houses,\nand never seeing her parents had a profund influence on\nher life. You may not think that Bobo is affected by what you\nsay and do, but I am certain that she is, and the fact that\nshe has a mother with her m kes an enormous difference . You\nhave always spoken to me of how wonderful you r life was with\nyour mother and how much she meant to you, and I feel that\nBo could or could not feel the same way latter in life\ndepending on whether she is with her mother or not. Please do\nnot feel that this is a suggestion that you should stay\nwith the children, because it is not. It is simply an idea\nthat may be basen on an entirely wrong premise and as a result\nworthless.\nI know a Warren Delano that is in stragegic\nservices out here. He comes into our office everyone once\nin a while to see the captain and seems to be able to le d\na very nice beach life besides as he is as brown as a berry\nand is always at the outrigger club when we go there. They\nall play some kind of a game with a basketball. Two men to a\nside and you knock the ball over a very high net. The court is\nsand which makes the running seem very difficult. The men\non one side knock it in the air between themselves until they\njockey into positions where they think they are able to hit [it]\nover the net so that their opponents cannot prevent it from\ntouching the ground. I am certain that it is a game for the\nyoung as it takes a great deal of running in the heavy sand and\nthe men are covered with perspiration.\nLast night we went to a dinner and a cocktail\nparty and then danced at the officers club in Hickham field.\nYou wouldhave died, had you seen us. Two old men asked out by\ntwo girls of about eighteen. We went to their fathers house for\ncoctails, a colonel in the army. There were lots of generals\nthere with a fair sprinkling of colonels and majors. I\nconsumed lots of bourbon, that is all that is drunk out here,\nwhy I don't know except they say that whenthe misssionaries first\ncame they sold the Hawaiians bourbon xxx because it was the ch\ncheapest liker to xxxx and therefor the greatest profit was\nrealized. The colonel was a little shaken when he saw Morrises\nbald head and my graying hair[,]but was very nice. After\ncocktails we went to the Army club for dinner andthere the\npiece de resistance was Artie Shaw and his orchestra. Of all\nthe lousy music that is the worst. People have sp[o]iled him and\nhis men so that they never have more than on instrument playing\nat a time, probably under the impression that is jazz or swing\nor something. My seat at the table confirmed my impression\nthat the colonel had recognized my age. I was sitting at the\nend of a long horseshoe table . On either side of me were men\nand beyoned them for two seats were more men so that the nearest\nwomen,who I did not know,was three seats away. I danced once\nand then the music st[o]ped at nine and the party was over.\nA general asked us to come back to his house for drinks so we\nwent there and had a big time pouring down bourbon and soda\n[End Page 2]\nuntil 9:45 when we returned to our home as you are not allowed\non the streets xxxxx after ten in a car. It use to be eight,\nbut they now let us stay until ten which is very liberal indeed.\nMorris and I felt very badly indeed this morning and have\nsworn no more of this foolishness for us. Back to our life\nof in bed at seven with time or the readers digest and to hell\nwith the young girls, their papas and the drunken old generals.\nIt is very cold here and has been for the past\nweek. Thatis cold in comparison with what it usually is.\nWe wear our kaki coats and overcoats in the morning, but it\nis quite warm by noon and one prespires in a shirt in the sun.\nHowever no one is one the beach in the afternoon, Hawaiins\nthink[scratched through] that swimm ming should only be done from June to Septe-\nmber. I have not surfXXed since that wonderful sunday two weeks\nago as there have not been any waves and besides it is really\nto cold in the evening to sit on a board with t he wind blowing\non ones back .\nGoodbye sweetheart, all my love goes with\nt is letter.\nSidney J. Legendre\nPS just spoke to the post office and they said all our letters\nfrom here go airmail, but they do not know what the situation\nis in the states whetehr your letters come out air mail\nor not. Ring the post office up and find out definitley.\n[End Page 3]"
