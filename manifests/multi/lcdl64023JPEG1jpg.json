      "value": "Combahee 9th November 1818 My dear Mother, I am happy to inform you that we have at last arrived at home; after experiencing a troublesome and fatigueing journey of three days. - you have probably heard of our disasters on the road, it is therefore needless for me to mention them. We are still very uncomfortable, as the Sloop has not yet arrived with our Servants and baggage, - we hope to hear of her tomorrow or the next day, - old Marian complains very much, in consequence of a violent cold which she took on the road and I am afraid will scarcely hold out until our young Nurses make their appearance. - The Children however are all quite well, and I flatter myself if the worst comes to the worst, I shall be able to manage them myself. - I suppose you will think this a piece of vanity, when there is such a riotous character as Edward in the case. -- I have [End Page 1] not seen Susan as yet, so that I cannot give you any information relative to the improvements of your other Grand-son: -- We shall probably go to Beaufort in the course of a fortnight, in consequence of Mr. Heywards giving up the idea of repairing the old Chateau, my visit will not be as long as I expected. I entirely forgot to ask you to send to Samory's for my wool Matrass, which was to be finished by the 11th, - will you be so good as to inquire about it, and send it up when you move into the Country, - I expect it will cost about twenty dollars. Give my love to Ann, tell her I hope she will spend her Christmas at Combahee, and that there will be nothing this time to prevent her paying me a visit of several days. Mr. Heyward continues quite well, and his appetite improves daily. he desires to be affectionately remembered to you, and with a kiss from all the boys for Aunt Bet, I remain yours ever Affectionately Hetty B Heyward.- [End Page 2] Pocotaligo 11 Nov Mrs. Nath. Heyward Charleston South Carolina Care of Miss'es Dart [and] Arears [End Page 3]"
