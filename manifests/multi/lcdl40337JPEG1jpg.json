      "value": "My Dear, Papa. I was very glad to hear of your encouragement in your ministry in Charleston & hope the good work begun may go on increasing. I heave read the pieces in the Evening News & am glad that so much is accomplished in So harmless a way. For I think your justification of the Bps unanswerable while you have not Entered into the [dust?] & heat of controversy. Such political capital has been made through the columns of the Evening News of Religious subjects, that [End Page 1] it as all important that Religious communities should confine their disputes to the Religious press & as Mr Walker tells me something of a paper to be established in Connection with the Ev. [Rv.?] Society. I hope you will reserve your anti Baptist battery for its Columns. Mr Richard Fuller is preaching most tremendously in B. fort with little effect as even the Baptists have very much cooled towards him & though I have not heard him, reports from others incline me to think that he is preaching up himself & his own Experiences & feeling so much, that the gospel[End Page 2] is [illegible] by him. Dr Fuller’s & family go Entirely too much to that Church. His pew in the Epis. Church is too often vacant or [thin?] for one so closely connected with the Baptists-- Aunt Betsy has been away & I suppose that accounts for it. I went into Communion yesterday morning, & heard a very fine sermon from Mr Walker. Saving 1 or 2 sentences about his new theory, brought in in Such away however as to Convince most persons. It was all theory, & imagination. If any thing could prove that Christ the King had already come it was the text he commented upon. “Behold thy King cometh, riding upon an ass & the foal &c.” Zechariah.[End Page 3] As Uncle R says about it though, “he is like the [toy?] called a “[illegible]”-- which Ever way they are thrown they always come right up on their bottoms.” He did not preach a crucified Jesus, the less for preaching something of him as a temporal King. Uncle Elliot is Expected here I believe, I hope he will Come. Aunt Smith writes word from Sav. that he is the “most improved spiritual preacher” she Knows. He is more & more like Mr Walker, & expressed the belief which she says is prevalent in Sav, that his afflictions have been blessed to him beyond all their pain. With much love & many prayers for all I am Your affec Son R W Barnwell.[End Page 4]"
