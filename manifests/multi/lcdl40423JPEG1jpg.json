      "value": "Columbia So Ca February 16th 1858 I received a few days ago Dear Mama your long letter which gave me the blues for a while but I afterwards remembered that I myself had gone thro similar [sickness?] & had not died there doing and so concluded to make the best of it and not fret while away. Robbie's friend Mr George Williamson has been with us not as long however as we would have liked, he is such a nice person. It really was delightful to witness how strong their friendship was. Mr W says he thinks Robbie but little changed and he could hardly imagine that four years had elapsed since their last meeting. I was quite amused at a mistake Charlie Barnwell made. He came in one day to dinner while Mr W. was here and not knowing he was already a married man said he thought Cathy was setting her [cap?] for him. I had a headache so spoke but little [illegible] Charlie said he supposed I was afraid it may appear as if this was the case and so kept quiet. He seemed quite disappointed when we told him afterward that Mr W was a married man as he said he was sure he would have been such a nice match for one of us. Ste scolded him for passing the judgments he did and told him if he knew us he would be well aware of the fact that we never tried to catch a [illegible] [illegible]. Still to [Sideways on top]: George forgot to take this to the office so it will not reach you until Mon. We received this morning the letters from Papa and Hettie and thank them for the same. Catty and self are going out now to spend the night with Mrs. [Artie G. ?][End Page 1] him doubtless it appears strange for we had become quite and on easy terms with Mr W. This afternoon we took such a pleasant walk to see the [Misses?] [Stark?] those \"old girls\" we have before mentioned, they are such nice [merry] ladies they were delighted to see us and made us promise to come soon again. If we three could ensure to ourselves such a happy life I would as soon have us all be old maids but they are independent and oh what a blessing that is. Teddie writes us that Aunt Mathews is losing her eye sight, have you yet heard of it? We do not hear very frequently from him. Most of the girls are away from Columbia, they return this week. We give our club party on Friday week. I hate the idea. I planned to return home on the 24th or rather leave Columbia then for I am \"homesick\", that is, \"Ma and children sick\". I really would like to return then but Robbie will not listen to it. I mentioned it last night and he instantly exclaimed against it, said he really would not hear of it, I must stay to the wedding and should not return home so soon. I said Hetty wanted to come and I really was tired but he said Hetty [illegible] come then for three months and I should soon be more willing to remain when my friends the [Goodwyns?] returned and he wanted it particularly. Thus if it so is, Hetty must feel how it is. Cattie can [illegible] testify to the fact that for the past week I have[End Page 2] become tired of Columbia and really wish to return. Don't you write to Robbie of it however for this he would not like. Willie continues to study and is now looking out for his boots they are to come this week and cost $75.00. He intends wearing them to the parties next spring to show the people what a handsome class his is (he says) if he is the ugliest. Today was the funeral of Col Wade Hampton -- a very large one I heard -- there were over three hundred of his negroes present and the church was really crowded. Robbie bought a nice match for Pauline for $85 -- not as pretty or well [illegible] a horse but one that looks very nicely -- a smaller horse with a nice new harness which we [illegible] and [illegible] buggy it really is an [illegible] [illegible]. Alec is [illegible] again at home. Judge Longst and his wife returned our call this afternoon he is too ugly, but very pleasant. She complains terribly to the noise at night and the ['row?'] all day - says she does not fancy her house & altogether the 'old lady' does not seem so well pleased. The students say the old judge or 'Bullet\" as they call him is an amusing man but very strict. Tell Hetty the only girls now here are the Shands, Mae Stark, Mary Singleton and Hattie Parker. We have been visiting the older ladies much more in consequence which pleases them \"mightily\". We see [illegible] constantly he drops in and no body minds him, this suits both parties and he so often says \"How I thank you[End Page 3] for letting me come here so sociably.\" He really is improved. Julius has improved vastly in washing and in \"[head matters?]\" she is more thoughtful and more capable than I ever presumed she could be. Catty says the soap [illegible[ Betsey makes is no cheaper and she intends to give it up. Catty made some nice strawberry ice-cream the other day which has made me unhappy [illegible] since I am constantly wanting some -- made it with those strawberries we told you we had [in?] tin cans. Robbie never writes I am surprised to see how he hates it. I am sure writing every [illegible] we have very little interesting to write of but still I know how you value letters. We have been reading desperately lately, books from the library. I do not practice much. We walk every day morning or evening. This morning I [illegible] Cattie's [flap?] [hat?] and [sat?] in the [illegible] [illegible]. It was so charming in our piazza with a book. The expenses of living are very great -- fire and light alone cost a fortune. We get up regularly at 8 1/2 oclock for breakfast and think that early. Robbie gets from recitations at 8. Miss Eliza Hayne is up here she heard Robbie preach [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] and I hear expressed herself enchanted. Give my love to all and thank Papa for the money it was quite acceptable. [Illegible] came last Sunday and said not having come at first he felt ashamed to come at all -- he says he paid $7.50 for us on the [illegible]. The mean old codger Uncle Smith, I shall never, no never forgive him. Beg Nan to write me. Yr affectionate daughter EB[End Page 4]"
