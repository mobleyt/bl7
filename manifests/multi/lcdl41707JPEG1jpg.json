Revd Father Hitzelberger arrived quite unexpected on Monday morning & said Mass for us. I am much pleased with him. He had not recd your letter - nor did it reach [In margin]: Francis sent me $10.00 a few days since -- was not that kind? And Revd P Oneill paid us $150. The Srs are all fervor? about the retreat & seem in excellent dispositions. [End Page 1] him until yesterday morning. He showed it to john who told me of your thoughtful kindness in so genteelly providing him with his travelling expenses. I wish you would let me know what is expected from us - I would prefer giving him the stole that was exhibited, but Sr Ursula seems unwilling to part with it. Poor Father Hitzelberger received a letter which he opened almost at our door this evening as he was coming to open our retreat & it contains the announcement of his brother's death -- a younger brother, who resided in N Orleans & who intended to meet him in Charleston, after he had finished our retreat. He was married but had no children -- R.I.P.[End Page 2] John & family are quite well, & he is delighted with Revd J H_'s company -- it is quite a recreation for him. John wrote to our dear Parents to name his little son, & they have called him James. Poor dear James, I cannot bear to hear so soon his name used, but it was born on the eve of the Apostle's feast. The Pittsburg Lady has written again & satisfactorily & we have told her she might come. I am sorry to say her $500 of which Bp OConner wrote, is only in expectation. Susan Francis' father has recently been baptised by Abp Purcell. Have you heard from Sister Mary lately, I begin to feel anxious about her long silence. Just as I expected, we could not arrange the Bellinger's bill & today recd a letter from Dr Northrop to whom we [End Page 3] will send the acct in full, as it stands in our books. Did you see Sister Antonia as you passed through Baltimore? I hope you enjoyed your time north, & found the \"Mutual admiration\" meeting pleasant. Would you have the kindness my dear Brother to correct our \"Prospectus on the (illegible)\" & say our academic (illegible) will be resumed on the first Monday in Sept. instead of the 26th, & change to $10.00 for drawing crayons. All join in grateful respects & beg your prayers & benediction. Please excuse haste & Pray for your own sister Ellen Sr Baptiste [End Page 4]"
