      "value": "m 2 21 44\n52\nR 3 8 44\nFeb 18,'44\nDear Sidney,\nI received to day your letter of Jan 4th no. ? Your\nordinary air mail one was much faster and of a much more recent date.\nJan 4th was that last air mail one- which I consider tops.\nYou sound terribly hard worked. I cant immagine keeping\nawake possible for 26 hours.I would be dead, dead sound asleep\nwith my head on the desk. I do hope it does n't mean flu germs and\nspine aches will follow, You must have a h--- of alot of work to do.\nI do hope its interesting. Your war out there seems to be going well,\nreally better than the one in the other theatre. It all takes alot of ti\ntime, and I cant understand people in Washington being so darn optimistic\nand making post war plans. They're nuts!It all boils down to the fact\none should never underestimate the enemy. \nThe other night I went out with a Big Shot to the the[a]tre\nA ranking tank man, a forw[a]rd fighting guy who has had great publicity.\nCharlie Codman took us behind the scenes to meet Jack Hulbert after\nthe show, and then wehad dinner at my flat. It is always fun to meet\nthe guys who run the war, and though less attractive than some- we\nhad a good evening. Last night I danced at Cero's with Raymond, Stacey\n-and some local inhabitants and had great fun. To-night I dine with\nAlfred Beit and so it goes. It sounds gay but you know what it means.\nJust hollow and something to do not to be left alone. I have thought so\nmuch about buying a spanial but think his life would be so tough with\nme in the office all day, and no walks in the park- that I have held off.\nTo-morrow I dine with Ben who seems to be rather weary these\ndays. He is forever entertaining the fallen nations and staying up with\nthem too late over glasses of brandy.\nMy fur coat is a godsend, and dear Rose is an angel the\nway she sends me little presents of food and what not. Miss Evans\nwrites the children are very well endeed and all is running smoothly\ndown there.\nI still take sun ray baths which keeps me from looking\nlike a worm and I do think it keeps colds to the minimum. Fortunately \nthe place is only three dooors from the office and I can pop in there \ntwice a week before or sfter lunch for half an hour. \nNo golf lately as we are unable now to get caddies, and its\ncold anyway.\nI had a lovely letter from Miss Charlotte about Anne and\nKathrine and she loves them both so much. She says they are both such\nsweet kids and such a great addition to the school. I had sent her a little\nsilver fox that she seems to love.\nI do hope you track that Xmas jewelry down as I have not\nreceived it.\nI am busy which is a blessing as otherwise I would have \nso much more time to spend missing you. \nAll my love-\tGertrude Legendre"
