      "value": "Charleston 13th Sept 1817 My dear Mother, I received your letter yesterday relative to Mrs. Griffin, and hasten to reply to it, though I know you can't possibly receive my letter before Bythewood leaves Beaufort- however your doing so would be of very little consequence, as I have determined to give up Mrs. Griffin altogether and am now trying to procure another nurse, -- it is indeed a disappointment to me, as I am particularly attached to Mrs. G- as a nurse, but I can't help thinking that she is perfectly right not to venture to come to Charleston, as to our accommodating her a whole month before hand is out of the question, so that her only plan now is to look out for another place.- We all continue quite well, and I believe the town is becoming a little more healthy,- I had a visit from Mrs. Finley the last week, the Doctor had frightened them a little by a fit of the fever, -- as he had been very much among persons with the yellow fever, they [End Page 1] thought of course he could not escape, but he has got quite well and I dare say is as busy as ever. I was perfectly astonished to hear that you consented to the Girls going to Pinckneys Island, and Hope they won't get sick but I think they deserve to have the fever and ague the whole Winter.- I am sorry to hear that little William is so fretful, I dare say that it is very much owing to his teeth, I suppose you don't expect to see Brother William before the middle of November as it certainly will be very imprudent in their venturing back before that time. do give my love to Mary and tell her how sorry I am to hear that she has had a return of the fever and ague, and tell Betsy that I receiv'd her letter yesterday and will answer it by the next post.-- do make the Girls write to me and believe me dear Mother to be Your ever Affectionate Child Hetty B Heyward [End Page 2] Mrs. Mary Barnwell. Beaufort. South Carolina. [numbers jotted below] [End Page 3]"
