      "value": "August 14, 1944\nDear Gertrude,\nI am a gardner of no mean ability. Life had become\nfrom the apartment to the office and return to such a\npoint that Like all old men I took up a hobby. There\nwere some old plants around the place that were dying\nfrom lack of water and I started by watering these.\nNext I moved them up to the pent house so that it is\nresplendent with green. When they become seedy on the\npent house I take them down to what I call my nursery\nwhich is a little walled in court yard next to one of\nthe ap[a]rtments. It is a sweet little court all walled\nin the fl[a]gged with courtstones. The people that live\nin the apartment have not used the court so I [a]m taking\nit over. I have horrible plants called crotons taht\nare just the things for you and I to grow. If you wate[r] \nthem they grow like weeds. If you dont water them \nthey grow much better than the average plant. No matt[er]\nwhat indiginty they suffer they bear up amazingly well\nand reward you with ugly red or striped leaves. I\npurchased a great deal of my stock from a women whose\nhusband had died and she was returning to the mainland.\n[Dont get excited she was an island resident.] I pa[i]d [her]\njust what the pots cost but Morris told me that I had\nbeen jipped because I c ould have squeezed her until she\nhowled[,] as she was a widder women. I do not know if I\ntold you that he went into seond hand store and\nstarted buying a set of china. The man wanted sixty \ndollars. When the argument had finished Morris walked\nout of the store with the china and a extra pot for\nten dollars. Now you have not heard me say that the\nchina w[a] worth the ten dollars, it consisted of an\nenormous soup tureen, I had not seen one since grand\nfather was a child, several platters that would hold\nenormous roast beef[s] and yo[u] cannot buy any thing larger\nthan a sparrow, and a couple of plates that are so\ndisigned that they are either spaniel bowls or were for\nmen with moustaches. Today was sunday and we really\nhad fun. A swim before breakfast, then the most \ndelicious breakfast on the porch of the outrigger club\nSliced pinapple, big hunks , scrambled eggs and sausages,\nwaff[L]es and loads of butter and syrup. Afterwards we\nwent to the office in our little car signed orders,\nshouted into our squak boxes and were generally very busy\nuntil twelve thirty. Sunday afternoon is our own[,] so\nwe came back[,] went swimming again. Then came to the\napartment house and started working. Morris has contr[o]l\nof the inside and was filing the china and peering into\ncornerswhile I watered the plants at the entrance, the\nnarrow strip of grass that seperates the bu[i]l[d]ing from the\nstreet and pruned my plants to a point that they wi[L]l\n[End Page 1]\nnever grow again. In the evening we made tongue sandwhiches\nwith loads of mayonnaise and lettuce leaves, and drank at \nleast a quart of milk apiece.\nI was famished because yesterday I went on a ship\nand had lucnh with an admiral and I can tell you that\nit reminded me of the old days at MiKes. Fruit salad and\nice tea. I could not believe my eyes. You would think\nthat an admiral would have the most wonderful food in the\nworld and that you would leve the table satiated. Maybe\nhe always wants to keep in fighting trim. Personally\nI enjoy eating so much that I spend the afternnoon in\na semi somulent state. He also had the habit of talking\nso low that you had to spread your ears like an elephants\nto even hear him whisper regardless of whether he was saying\nanything_worth while. You know there are people like that[,]\nEugene P[a]ynal use to talk so low that one could not bother\nto listen to him at all. However you have to listen to an\nAdmiral as long as you are in the navy. When the war is\nover that of course will not be necessary. You may reast\nassured that when I came on the ship I saluted everything\nthe wrong way and failed to salute the things that I should\nhave. I have a pin to match the earrings I sent you and \nalso a pin and a little pair of sea horse earrings. Do\nyou want me to send them at you APA address or somewhere\nin F[R]ance or would you rather have me send them to Rose and\nhave herx resend them to you[,] because maybe you h[a]ve greater\nsuccess in receiving things from her than you do from me.\nI sent Landine and Rose, Miss Evans and Bo some pocket books\nmade out of woven grass that are very smart. I dd not send\nyou any because I cannot imagine you carrying a grass pocket\nbook around in that cold climate. It would be lixke an\neskimo with an electric fan.\nLeonard Cus[k]ing spent the night with us and said\nthat Atherton Richard[']s must be crazy because Lenorad told\nAtherton that wives were not allowed to come to Honlulu\nas he had looked the question up for you. I understand \nthat the battle of washington is over and that you can get\nhouses and laundry done there now without any trouble and\nthat all the people that were buying houses there last year\nas an investment are now stuck withx[t]hem and wish to god\nthey had never seen or heardf the city. Also that The\ngood old USA is very gay. Long island, Southhampton,\nNewport and a long line of places are gayer than they have\nbeen for years and that it is impossible to rent a house\nthere. Also all the war workers that have come back from\nthe battle of Washington sit up and now tell you how the\neuropean war should be run from their seats in the racquet \nclub. The strikes are unbelievable. It just seems\nimpossible that men could strike over such petty things\nwhen other s are being blown to bits on battle fields.\nHowever that is human beings and it is what must expect.\nAll my love darling.\nSidney Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
