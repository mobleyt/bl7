      "value": "[Otho Holland Williams to Nathanael Greene\n October 2, 1782\n[RvW Box 1 Folder 23; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\nFrederick Town 2.d October 1782 -\nDear General,\nThe obscurity of my situation for some time\npast has not only deprived me of opportu-\nnities of writing to you, but even of the\nknowledge of matters worthy of communi-\n-cation – If Mrs. Greene has received my\nLetter from Bath you have been informed\nwhat a complication of pain and pleasure\nI experienced there during six weeks the\nlast summer. A variety of agreeable company,\na good share of health, and a full flow\nof spirits were all insufficient to banish\na chronic Rheumatism which tortured me\nextremely, nor were the celebrated waters\nof Bath more efficatious [sic]. -  since my return\nfrom the springs  I have used the cold bath\nconstantly ‘till about ten days ago with\nvery little advantage. I have used a hundred \nother\n[Endorsed in margin:] From Genl. [General] Williams\nOct.r 2d. 1782\n X\nPrivate 145\n[End Page 1]\nOther expedients, but none of them have answered\ntheir recommendations, every one accounting\nhis remedy infalliable [sic]. Impatience induced me to vary\nexpedients, and Fancy hit upon the warm baths; that\nhas been of infinite service to me and my former agility is now\nalmost perfectly restored. –\nOn the tenth and eleventh of last month some\nconfiscated Lands were sold here for the redemption of\nthe certificates given to Officers and Soldiers of the \nMaryland line. It was the intention of the assem-\n-bly, and the conditions of sale were calculated, to\ndispose of the Lands at the highest possible prices,\nand the folly of the officers complicated the plan. –\nInstead of associating ourselves into a company [and] \nto purchase by agency [as it was advised] we all\ncrowded to the sale, and coming in competition\nwith each other, and vieing [sic] with speculators, who had\nbought certificates at a very great discount, we\ninjudiciously bid very extravagantly for the Land –\ndispairing [sic] of any other or more favorable opportunity of disposing\nof my certificates I also purchased upon these terms\nand my business here now is to dispose of my \nLands as advantageously as I can for a little ready \nmoney\n[End Page 2]\nmoney for expences, the want of which has been a prin-\n-cipal cause of my remaining so entirely out of the\nintelligent parts of the World- You may be assured\nmy Dear Sir, such is the poverty of my finances and of my private friends, that a\ncertain Major General was not more embarrassed by\nwant of Cash when he sold his spoons in Virginia, than\nI now find myself    This deficiency has entirely\nlocated me, I dare not go out of Maryland, [where\nI live upon courtesy] for fear of creating creditors\nwho will not make proper allowances for my\npennyless [sic] condition. –\nI do not know anything more of what is doing \nin the North than what is said in the public prints\nwhich you will probably receive before this, and I\nshould be more ignorant of what passes in the South\nbut for a letter from Captain Dyer to Doct.r Thomas\nof this Town. He gives a very short indifinate [sic] account\nof Genl. [General] Gists expedition to Cumbahee [Combahee] ferry, the only\nthing he mentions with any certainty is the fall\nof Colonel Lawrence [John Laurens] which I lament most earnestly.\nThat sensible, Gallant, Elegant fellow was one of the \nvery few whom I loved and envied. –\nTwo\n[End Page 3]\nTwo letters, only have I had the honor to receive from\nyou since I left Camp, neither of these advise me\nwhether you wish my return. I'm exceeding glad\nit has not been necessary, as hitherto it has been\nnext to impracticable   If however, by the sale of my Lands,\nor a part of them, or by any other means I can raise \nmoney, nothing wou'd give me more pleasure than\nto hear I can be of further service [while any service\nremains] or that it is in my power to serve you in -\n-dividually. you are assured there is nothing I wou'd \ndo with greater cheerfulness than to serve you, or with\nyou; therefore I beg you will command me, or if\nthere shou'd not be an occasion, pray consider the line\nof my military existence, How, or whether, the arrangement \nof the army to take place in January, will affect me as\na junior Officer, and oblige me with your advice\nMy affectionate compliments await Mrs. Greene and\nall the Gentlemen of my acquaintance, to whom I\nmust be excused for not writing now – I have not time\neven to correct this, as much as it wants it; Mr. Osborne\nis gone from his Quarters in Virginia and this follows\nhim by a sudden, unexpected opportunity –\nI am, D.r [Dear] General, with sincerest affection\nMost truly, Yours\nGen. l [General] Greene\t\t\tO.H. [Otho Holland] Williams\n[End Page 4]"
