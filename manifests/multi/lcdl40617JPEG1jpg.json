      "value": "Sandy Knowe Monday May 13th 1843 Well, My Dear Mamma, and so you are again once more at home. I do indeed welcome you both back--Tare in her letter before the last seemed greatly disappointed and rather uneasy about you having expected you in the Boat--she promised to let me know immediately of your arrival, which she did, and, indeed, you do not know how I longed for the day to arrive--her letter made me feel very happy--I was delighted to know that you were both well and so near--and now I hope to see you very soon. We have fixed upon today [fortnight?] to leave--We'll go up to Friendfield that afternoon and make a very early start the next morning hoping to reach Philips, so the next day Wednesday, you may see us to dinner--however, our movements depend somewhat on weather, for, if we should have it cool next week, we shall avail ourselves of it for the journey--so you may see us sooner--from the 25th to the first of June--as the weather best suits--The Spring has been so backward that it does not seem at all late to be here--We have had several [illegible] of strawberries we take them after tea--How do yours do? but I'm afraid I'll not have enough to preserve They ripen slowly. Saturday afternoon we paid Mrs. Bard a visit-- [End Page 1] we [staid?] to tea and had a delightful row by moonlight--quite a pleasant excursion--this afternoon we return Mrs. Peter Fraser's visit--so I hope to enjoy another moonlight row--really, I like boating very much when calm--I find it not at all formidable as I used to think--one Sunday, indeed, going down to the Chapel I was a little frightened for the boat danced not a little--but otherwise I like it very much. Mr. & Mrs. [Glennie?] came up to a late dinner Friday and left us the next morning--Mrs. Heriot came over and dined with us the other day and this is all the company--so you see, Mamma, my good luck continues--And what are your summer arrangements Mamma? Sara told me you came in your carriage so I suppose you brought Cupid along too--did you leave Hetty? Is he to [illegible] the cook? I long to see you to hear all about your winter--Poor [Miss?] Mary ann's death must have made you feel dull. I have not told Charlotte yet--I thought it better for her not to know it until about getting home--she asked the other night if I had heard from you--I take her with me--the rest go in about ten days, so if we remain longer we'll have but Charlotte and Frank--And I'll send with them a beautiful little puppy which I do not like to leave here--Rolls--do, Mamma, see that he is taken good care of until I come--Tell Tare, that he is a great pet of mine and I'll put him in her charge--tell her to be on the look out, and charge the little negroes not to disturb it--and beg her to see that they do not hurt him--I should be very sorry to lose him.[End Page 2] I am hoping to receive a letter from Stanna today--and only think--the first--But you, Mamma, too, have treated me not near as well as I had hoped--only two letters--and I prized them so highly--I think I ought to have had them much oftener--and from Mr. Memminger--one and a half--if not for Tare, I should have been constantly harrassed by disappointments and anxiety--Jane Read was to leave in the Boat today--I suppose you'll see her soon--and I wonder what Miss Charlotte has done with herself, and whether they have got a house. Mrs. Belin leaves tomorrow--it will be quite dull with so small a family--So, Mamma, tell Tare, that I shall not want my curtains put up as I intend having green blinds as soon as I get down--it will be a great improvement to the room for them. I can exclude the sun--I suppose, [illegible] will have to cut my mat to make it fit, as it covered [illegible] large room--and I hope they thought of putting my own bedstead in my room? as, if not too much trouble I would prefer it--Do, Mamma, throw some camphor about in my room and in the closets--the gum I mean--it is excellent for insects and I want to try its virtue with fortylegs--it might prevent the intrusion of one--I mean to make much use of it to try the efficacy of it--So, Mamma be sure to do it Tuesday--And now I come to finish--Mrs. Belin leaving us today puts me all in the humour, however, the preparation for our departure will occupy me--a plenty to do--however, Mr. Belin will do his full share for me--We must get through this week, that if next week be cool we may be ready--We got home last night at about 10 o'clock--we waited for the moon--and then regaled ourselves with[End Page 3] strawberries and cream. This was our last water visit we have finished them now--Mrs. Fraser desired her love to you all--she was very sociable and spoke of old times with much pleasure--said she had often spoken of the pleasant week she spent with us in Philadelphia--they have one daughter in whom they seem wrapped up--Well, this is my last letter--I long to see you all much more than you care to see me I am sure--and the time seems to have passed by very quickly, too. When you left us it seemed like so long a time before we should see you again--but here it is at [last?]. My most affectionate love to Papa--and now I must say goodbye, Dear Mamma, until I see you--Much love to Tare and all the rest-- Yr affec daughter Virginia W. Belin Do bug Tare not to let any mosquitoes find their way into my room-- Mrs. Willis Wilkinson Care of Dr Willis Wilkinson Charleston So Ca Mr. B's love to yrself & Papa & all the rest-- [End Page 4]"
