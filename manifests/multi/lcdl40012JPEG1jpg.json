How for is it right to decline the office of Bishop, seeing that it [hole in MS] a degree of the Ministry which cannot be attained except thro' a call of this kind? 2ly. What do you think of the fields? of usefulness? a comparative? point of view, both present & future [illegible], or my present one?[End Page 1] 3.ly. How should I be giving more glory to God, by accepting or refusing, under the circumstances in which I have been recently placed with respect to the Episcopal office in this state? If I know mine own heart at all, my duty is what I desire to know & understand.
