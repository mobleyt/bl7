      "value": "Charleston, SC, Oct. 4th, 1873 Dear Maddie, Your letter to Maria reached me this morning and as we were all very anxious to hear from Acton, I sent it down to Maria's by our boy, with the request that she would return it for Anna and Trap to see-- I was indeed grieved to hear that Mother was till too sick for you to return-- we feared from the absence of letters and your not coming that there was no good news to communicate and Anna had a crying spell at the prospect-- I do hope that one of you will write by every mail until Mother is much better, if you are pressed for time you can at any rate send a Postal Card-- Maria has written and Trap taken the note to Miss [Senion?] too-- I called upon Mr. Gormike and he says that the note to Miss S. will answer if you are detained for a few days only, should you be kept a week or ten day over the time you can address a communication to him stating the case and asking for what you want. Anna and Keith are well, both looking remarkably well although K. has a slight cough which sometimes worries him at night-- Theodore agrees to become [illegible] for our boy so we only await the return of yourself Mim and Mother when we expect to have him baptised-- Carrie and S. have returned-- Maria was up [illegible] on Wednesday afternoon, I rode down with her[End Page 1] Anna Trap and I to St. Michaels together on Sunday and occupied my pew-- there was a small congregation I fear it will continue small unless they reduce the assessments-- my half pew now costs $35 and I have heard of persons leaving on account of viability to pay-- I have paid in advance to Jany. 17th and tell Anna that she can certainly go there until that time how much longer I don't know-- for at present there is literally no business doing-- and under the circumstances it behooves me to reduce expenses where I can-- We went to Maria's after the service and after talking and playing with the children awhile took Trap with us to dinner-- I am glad to say that we see much of T. especially in the evenings, I think that his namesake proves something of an attraction for him in addition to the regular occupants of the parlor-- I will have that letter to the society attended to-- for your information will state that Mother holds a \"State of the S.W.R.R.B.K. for $6000--\" not a bond as you wrote-- Thinking that your P. Cards may be out I send a half dozen and hope that you will not forget to use them for we are anxiously awaiting news of Mother by every mail-- Give much love to Mother, Mim and Willis hoping to hear good news of the former by next mail. I am very affectionately Yr. Bro. Alex.[End Page 2]"
