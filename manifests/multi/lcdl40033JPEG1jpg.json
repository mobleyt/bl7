      "value": "Brooklyn Oct 4, 1843 My dear Brother Barnwell, I will not construe your fear that to answer your letter will cause me \"trouble\", into a desire on your part, that I should not do so, but will avail myself of the first opportunity, that my engagement permit, to assure you that I have never ceased to feel a deep interest in your welfare. You refer to times that are past. I do indeed remember the impression made on me at first hearing you preach, before I Knew who were. I saw that you [were?] evidently searching after truth, that you [were?] dissatisfied with the then low state of spirituality in the Church. I have great reason to thank God that he has enabled me since that time to see much more of the \"beauty of holiness\" & to have much clearer & more definite view of the freedom & fulness of the salvation in our lord Jesus Christ. I have found in the interpretation of the H Scriptures by the Catholic Church, a sure & safe guide. By the light thus afforded, I see how, that our salvation is all of grace thro faith.\" Not on account of any act of ours-- not on account of any faith or belief or ours & least of all on account of any selfish [thot?] that we have been \"personally elected\"-- [illegible] is[End Page 1] because the Saviour freely gave himself; & gave his Church, gave his sacraments; gave His Holy spirit to be the life of both; that, as many as are baptised are baptised [illegible] his death, as many \"as feed on [illegible] his flesh & drink his blood\" are one with him, he dwelling in them & they in him-- it is I think on these accounts only that salvation is attainable-- If, My dear Brother, you have stopped short in you inquiries, since I saw you, & are still [resting?] on [what?] I now think [were?] but partial & defective views of the good plan of salvation, I am very sorry-- I beg you to forgive me, (for I take great shame to myself for my former ignorance & unbelief) If I have been, at any time, the means of [confirming?] you in error; and you have the prayers of your [unworthy?] Brother, that the Spirit of truth, which has led so many of \"the [evangelical?] school,\" such as [Marion?] & [Percival?], & [Newman?] & [Percy?] in England, & Ebbs & Parks & [Henshaw?] & others [in?] this, country [thro?] the mazes of Protestantism to [illegible] the beauty of Cath. truth, may lead you also to drive away all \"strange [doctrines] contrary to Gods word,\" & to rest confidently on the [Promise?] made to the Church of Christ, [illegible: who?] is his body, rather that to fancies of your own \"[personal] [election?]\" but you permit me to speak with frankness & candor on another subject, not alluded to in your letter; but one upon which I have [thot?][End Page 2] much & which has caused me much pain when you have been called to my remembrance in the Papers acknowledging Missionary [receipts?]. May I ask you, as a Christian Brother soberly to think, how it is possible that you should have sent thousands of dollars to far distant China, as a mere experiment (which has turned out unsuccessful as well might have been expected) while you live in the midst of millions of souls left in [heathenist?] [illegible] or bewildered by Protestant fanaticism-- Have you never [thot?], that Christ died as well for the poor slaves who surround you, as for the men in China-- & you have permitted a generation to pass [illegible], while you have been more concerned for those thousands of miles distant-- Will you excuse me, dear Brother, for the freedom that I have taken-- I can but think that thro \"ignorance you have done this\" & I will set apart the next day of fasting & prayer appointed by the Church, to pray for your [conversion?] & (must I say? repentance)-- for I am sure you will see, at some future time that like Peter you have ignorantly in this \"sinned against God\". You speak of Dr Tyng-- I have good hopes for him, it is a good sign when one who has been so [wedded?] to all error, begins to discover some truth-- I have been pleased with his defence of our much persecuted Bishop in the last [Recorder?]-- God grant that his eyes may be opened to see the whole truth[End Page 3] [written on side of page:] Rev. E M Johnson The Rev. Wm H. Barnwell Charleston S. Carolina After I shall have seen some numbers of your paper, My dear Brother, I shall be able better to say whether I can recommend it-- Papers have so increased in numbers of late, as to afford little hope of much encouragement for a new one in this quarter-- With the most perfect respect for yourself & with great charity [illegible] for your errors & [will?] [devout?] Prayers for your recovery from them, I am, dear Brother, yours most truly in Christian bonds Evan M. Johnson[End Page 4]"
