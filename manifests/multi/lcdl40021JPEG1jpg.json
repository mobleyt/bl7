      "value": "[Kri-larry-sri?] Nov. 3. 1842. My Dear Brother It is several months since I have written to you & since my last it had pleased God in his infinite wisdom to visit me with some affliction. My Dear wife was taken away as in a moment. My serious fears were not excited until within six hours of her end, so inconceivable did it appear to me that God would take her away just when all China was opening to our labors. But his ways are not as our ways. He had supported my heart by the firmest persuasion that all has been done in infinite wisdom & love. Her life & death leave me without a single doubt of her present felicity & [illegible] this whole world cannot fill the [illegible] her loss has created or make up to my children their irreparable loss, yet the Savr's love can & does fill that blank & his care will guard her precious offspring. It has been good for me to be thus afflicted. I have never had such evidence before of being a child of God as I now possess. I have never before been so severely tried & had grace given with the whole heart to acquiesce in & [illegible] God's will to my own. For her there is nothing to wish. Length of days were not granted to her, but \"that life is long, which answers life's great end\" And all I ask for myself is that I may be permitted to follow her as she followed Jesus & lay down my life in the same great cause in which she was permitted to surrender hers. We can meet no more in this world, but she is with Jesus & he is with me. This must be our bond of union until we meet in his presence to part no more. Since Mrs Boone's death we have all been sick. My children have been a cause of great anxiety, both sick & no one to take care of them, their nurse being sick also & this at the same time that I was suffering under an attack of fear; but the Lord has in mercy spared life. Henry is quite [written on side of page:] Not be without some use so as to compensate in some measure for loss of time from China. Pray that it may prove so. Remember me affectionately to Mrs Barnwell & to all my friends. May the richest blessings of the divine Redeemer rest upon you & your charges. If you have not seen my letter [End Page 1] well again & Mary is improving slowly. My own health is better; the affections of my head I trust much better, I have had very little trouble there for six weeks until within the last three or four days but am now suffering severely probably from loss of sleep in attending upon Mary at night. When she gets well & this cause is removed I hope I shall be quite relieved by the aid of the coming winter. In the midst of my personal afflictions, the cheering prospects for China which have been developed have animated me with the most sanguine expectations, of the divine blessing upon this portion of the great vineyard. That heart must be singularly cold indeed which does not glow with gratitude for such a termination of the China war & for the wide & open door which God has up before the church which I am fully persuaded no man will ever henceforth be permitted to shut. There are millions now, who have direct connection with tens of millions, to whom we can have access & that too of a character the most encouraging. At Amoy we really cannot see that we want anything more for the successful persecution of our labors, than the spirit to dwell richly in our own hearts, to rest upon our labors & to give as a fuller & freer use of the language. A wide door is set open before us. The people of all classes treat us with the greatest respect & give good attention to our conversations & to our instructions on Sunday. At family worship we have eight servants & a few [illegible] every day. On sunday a congregation of 50 very steadily, some time ago there were more who attended, but the neighborhood has been very sickly & I attribute the falling off to that cause. Mr. Abeel & I preach alternately as we have no place as yet for holding two services. Throughout the week we see a goodly number. I have frequently had an acquaintance bring into my house some 6 7 or even 10 strangers & say \"these men live two or three days journey off, but being at Amoy & hearing of you, I have brought them over to hear of[End Page 2] Yea-- Saw\" (Jesus). On such occasions I tell others of the fall & set the atonement before them as the only hope of the sinner, give them a gospel & a few tracts & commend them to God's blessing. In this way multitudes have already heard of the only name under heaven whereby the sinner can be saved. A few days since the [Hae-Hong?] of Amoy invited us to go over & see him. He is the 2nd civil officer of Amoy when all the offices are filled but at present the chief. He sent his card & sedan chairs Mr. Abeel was sick but Mr. McBryde, Dr. Cumming & I went. He treated us with great politeness, said he had heard of our good deed which made him want to see us & hoped we would come over to Amoy to live that he might see us oftener. Dr. Cumming however appeared to be in his eyes much the most benevolent man, as he healed the sick & gave medicines away for nothing, which had a very favorable effect upon all the Chinese. When he heard that we did not trade or make money in any way, he asked very pointedly how we managed to get something to eat, I told him then of our missionary Societies, laying great stress upon the fact that it was the pity Xns at home felt for idolators who were [illegible] in their sins that induced them to give their money. He listened attentively to a statement of the doctrine of the atonement & accepted of a copy of the testament & several tracts. The Lord add his blessing. We are waiting for Sir Henry Pottinger to come down that we may learn the terms of the treaty in respect to Amoy after which we expect to move over into the city, where we shall have a population of 1 to 200,000 immediately around us. Don't let our friends at home suppose that China is any longer shut & especially urge upon our young men the need of [written on side of page:] to Mr. DeSaussure of Sepr. 2. giving an account of Mrs Boone's illness & death ask him for it as I have no doubt it contains several statements that will interest you. Affecty. & sincerely Yr. Br. in Christ Wm. J. Boone[End Page 3] prompt & vigorous efforts to occupy this new territory the Lord has set before us. None but our very largest cities present so many within the direct influence of a laborer, & they by no means have such masses as are all around us here. I do trust & heartily pray that our church will be aroused to do some thing. To send out five or six more at once. Help me with your prayers & with your influence to effect this desireable object. I have the melancholy duty before me of returning to America, which I supposed I had left for life-- It costs me more than coming out did, but I think my duty to my children requires it. Every day I stay my labors become more interesting, I can make the Gospel plainer to those around me, & it is a trial under such circumstances to be absent for [illegible] [illegible] & instead of progressing retrograde in my absence. My heart shrinks too from leaving my children to see them perhaps no more & come out again a solitary man; but God promises strength as [our?] day, this promise had never failed me & never will. In his strength then I shall address myself to this duty & by his permission be with you in the Autumn of 1843. I hope my visit to America may [written on side of page:] Rev W.
