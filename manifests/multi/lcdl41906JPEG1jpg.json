      "value": "A.M.D.G Ursuline Convent & Academy (At Methodist F. College Pro. tem Columbia So Ca July 17th 1865 Dearest Brother, You will be gratified to hear that things here begin to assume quite a cheerful appearance. The rails, so long interrupted, are becoming regular again. Business letters are passing pretty briskly, express wagons running as before. Merchants going north to try their stock of goods, the war &c ignored &c &c. I have just received a letter from our old friend Henry F. Baker replying to one of mine, saying he would with pleasure do business for us as heretofore & another from one of our pupils gone north, a Miss Kate Harris, niece of Mrs. Dr. Robert Emmett of New York, saying she had shipped us a box of goods which I sent for by her, in lieu of the payment of her bill. I expect that this winter will be a very busy & brisk one, especially with Merchants & Mechanics. We have met with so much kindness & sympathy that we cannot feel sufficiently grateful, & when you return to us next spring, you will be delighted to hear it all--more than I can write. Brother John & I both hear from Cheraw pretty regularly--our dear Parents enjoy their usual health. Mother suffers from rheumatism in her ankles. Anna says they swell considerably at times, but she will not remain quiet. Father is weakened by the heat as he is every summer, but otherwise quite well. T.G. Francis has taken Conlaw into partnership with him & both are much pleased with the arrangement. Conlaw is a fine manly Boy. Both tanyards were burned & since[End Page 1] the freedmen walked off with themselves. Francis will concentrate ihs labors & work only one yard. He is very cheerful as usual. If Providence has such adversity to the South, He has certainly give it a beautiful spirit of cheerful submission to His holy will. Sister Antonia, tells me that she wrote to you lately & sent you a part of Anna's letter. I also wrote to you telling you that I hoped you would remain in Europe until the military & civil authorities would decide between them, which we shall consider as the powers that be-- this is I suppose until next Spring. You will be gratified as every one else is to learn that the governor appointed under our present region, is Mr. Perry of Greenville--the friend of Mr. Dudley of Marlborough, & your friend too, John says. I suppose he will soon put things in [illegible] to the satisfaction of all concerned. We have our school still in operation & do not intend to suspend it this summer, unless when Revd Father Gache who is stationed in Charleston now, will visit us & give us a partial retreat. We have only thirteen boarding pupils, nor do I expect we can well take more until we build, which will take us about two years at least. In the mean time we will accept the offer of Genl Preston to take his house for our convent, while his family are travelling in Europe & we hope by the time they will want it, our convent will be completed. Of course the \"ways & means\" will be quite a consideration, but I have taken good Mother Margaret of Cincinnati for my model in this business, & have no doubt of our success with God's blessing & the proper permission from you. We have written a circular to[End Page 2] all the Bishops in the United States--mentioning the burning of our Convent & asking aid to rebuild as speedily as possible. We have also written to Washington representing the facts, & asking an indemnification for our losses. I am assured that both will meet with a favorable hearing & response. Many kind friends--(all Protestants)--have told us to count on their assistance when we begin to build. They are particularly anxious that we would not accept any invitation to go elsewhere. You do not know how very polite Genl A.S. Hartwell whose Hd Qrs are at Orangeburg--has been to us, when Genl Hatch from Charleston advised us to go North & offered free transportation. Genrl Preston said with indignation, \"What, they are not content with robbing us of our silvers, but would also rob us of our nuns! Col Seibels also offered us the use of their house for a while & have been very kind. Mr. Col. Bausket offered hers to us for the summer. We thanked them all, but as yet have kept ourselves quiet & our school going on the best we could. One day school was very good until the heat because excessive & will no doubt be again in the writer. It has occurred to me to establish day schools in one or two other places temporarily until our Convent was built - by sending \"detachments\" of Sisters--say three in number, two Choir & one Lay to Macon, Ga. (with permission of Bp Verot)--another to Raleigh, N.C. (spiritual aid will be wanting there I fear) & in that way, support ourselves & disseminate our holy faith--our mission seems to be, making converts in which we continue with God's blessing to succeed. One of our pupils returned to us yesterday more to be instructed in our holy Faith, than to study her books. She is 19 years of age & has the consent of her Parents. It occurred to me that if we could not raise im-[End Page 3] immediate funds to carry on the work of our convent for I apprehend no difficulty in two years hence. We could do as the Ursulines of Brown County did--they borrowed $10,000 in specie from the Visitation Convent of Paris at .6 per cent with the privilege of paying it when Convenient, & they took 15 years to do it. I do not think we would require as many. Oh! How I would like to talk all this over with you. Mr. [illegible] is my man of business! but we have only planned as yet- to begin soon however, for no time is to be lost every one says. Do write me a long letter--I have never received one line from you since you left Halifax! And we have [illegible] for nearly a year before peace was declared, before we heard a word of, or from you. How is Robert, & was I right about his vocation? In my next letter, I will tell you more about each individual member of our community. Today Genl Blanchard & family have vacated Valle Crucis & I do hope the Jesuit Fathers will soon be in possession of it, giving to the diocese what it so much needs & a new railway is being cut or rather surveyed near the \"Wallace farm\" by Capt Hayden, which John says will render it more valuable. I hope the [illegible] Brothers will soon come & establish their Manual Labor School. I think John has done well as you could expect in these times & will be relieved when this property is in other good hands. Daniel & his family are just & good & faithful servants as ever, but Isaac is thoroughly trifling & ungrateful. I suppose from what Dr. Cummings says you will take a tour before you return on a questing expedition, but if so & you succeed in raising funds to rebuild your Cathedral &c, be sure & leave it over in Europe for it is not advisable or safe to own property on this side of the Atlantic. Mr. Trenholm & many others are assured of that fact. (A word to the wise &c) When you write please tell me if you received any of my many letters to you & mention some of the items that I may know which ones reached you. All send very grateful respects & beg your prayers & benediction, especially Sister Gertrude & your own Sister.[End Page 4]"
