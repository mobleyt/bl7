      "value": "8 P.M.\n75\t\tMedway-\nMarch 4th 43-\nDear Sidney my darling,\nIf I could only describe the\nSouth as graphically as you did the gunnery school-\nI can first see the life of the gunnery school- I see you were\nthe star pupil [and] took all the honors. I do hope learning \nto shoot these guns is not going to fit you for a \nfloat top- please assure me there will be no chance\nof that.\nNow to describe to you-\nfirst, the Palmetto Limited dropping me off with\nmy 3 pieces of luggage at Mt Holly at 7.45_!!\nOf course no one to meet me at such an hour-\nThe tram has never been known to come on time\n[and] certainly never ahead of schedule. The temperature\nwas 26[percent] [and] felt about as cold as Washington.\n\"Adam\" was the first man I saw, he came to-\nwards me down the platform in that long black over coat\n[and] felt hat. We discussed the weather [and] he asked\nhow the [illegible] blessed your soul- soon Sam\nGantt looking more like a frilly billy cracker\nthan anything else in the world appeared with \nhis truck- then the men gathered [and] we\nstarted in [and] Rose met me on the road\nwith the Plymouth 1 2 way in, [and] soon we were\nclipping down the hell to the cause way [and] the lake,\n[End Page 1]\nthe ducks swam a little further away\n[and] flapped their wings- we were under that\navenue of oaks, [and] drawing up to the brick\nterrace- I stood on the terrace for a minute\n[and] watched the crimson ball of sun\ncast that wonderful pink [and] gold light\nfrom behind the oak trees silluetting\nthem in a, blazzing glory- [illegible] lovely-\nyou [and] I have so often after duck \nshooting- everything is so still, the moon hangs\nthe mist rises, everything is covered with dew.\nWhat peace! There is nothing like it.\nThe house was open- everything in place exactly \nthe way you [and] I always lived in it- pictures\n- curtains, books [and] ash trays- I wandered\nall about [and] expected to bump into you\nin every room- so queer not to find\nyou- I wandered to the stable, looked at\nthe horses with Walter- He couldn't secure\nclippers so the horses look well but shaggy.\nWalter runs the Plantation, is a fine fellow\nI think. Dave seemed fine too-\nMrs. F [illegible] had formally secured 125 gal.\nof [illegible] oil for us from the Rationing board-\nSam [illegible] the furnace with a hose with out\nputting it- into the tank, because Sam insists\n[End Page 2]\n2\nthe tank leaks which accounts for our losing\nthat 1000 gallons- well the house was a \nice box, so when the steam finally came on\nwe were able to take off our coats.\nCandice, Rose, Lizzie [and] Pearl were all there.\nSo nice too, after all those dreadful Washington\n\"blacks.\" Rose [and] I stocked the little bar,\narranged Reggie Winn's room in the guest \nhouse, swept the terrace, generally worked \nmost of the day. It was a cold clear\nday. Isak was heart-broken over the \"freeze\"\nkilling everything [and] almost in tears he\ntold me his [illegible] [and] geraniums were all\nfrozen [and] burnt. I had Louis climb up \na ladder to cut the vines out of my chimney\nso I could light a fire in my bedroom\nwhile every one was hard at work washing\nwindows, polishing floors etc. etc- a great\ncloud of smoke darkened the sky- every hand\nlaid down what that were doing [and] went\noff to the fire. It was a cross the\nsea-board by Sam Gant's house- a big \npiece- considering the ground is\nsoaking from 2 days rain. I am surprised\n[End Page 3]\nthis was possible- and thought the whole\nthing a most typical Medway afternoon.\nI wandered to the office, to your little tiny\noffice, to grandmothers garden- there were\na few yellow jonquils in bloom- I looked at \nClippy's grave [and] wished he were at my\nheels. Medway with out you [and] with\nout dogs is a lonely, empty, eerie spot.\nI expected some how to see you [and] Tanny\naround a corner- it would have been \nso natural- The place really is\nfull of you everywhere- I can't explain\nit- I went to the sheds [and] expected to\nsee you standing over the combine\nor leaning on the tractor discussing\nteh planting of lespedeza- Walter [and] Dave\nboth asked about you- How you were\netc.- I found it hard to talk about\nyou with out choking and gulping a few\nunruly tears.\nAt five-thirty it got cold, I sat by the gun room\nfire looking over our shelves of books, [and] every now\n[and] again reading a portion of a poem or a diary.\n[End Page 4]\n3\nAt 7o'clock I came up to my room to\nbed- Here I am- the paneled walls are lovely,\nthe fire is burning [and] whistling as I am\npropped up wishing this to you- your bed\nis so empty- what I would give to have \nyou in it beside me at this moment would \nbe in everything I [illegible]. I can see you\n[illegible] curly head with your face burried in my\nlap while I rub your curly head [and] we \nhuggle [and] huggle. Medway is meant\nfor we two people- not for one alone. It's got\ntoo many memories of us to gether, but I do \nfeel close to you, although I feel sad-\nI think these oaks, this moss, the silent, peaceful\nhouse is just what I needed most- It \nrestores one's sence of values [and] really calms\none's soul- I feel better already. A week\nof this will be wonderful as I know I shall\nsleep [and] sleep [and] never wake up-\nI have all day to-morrow here alone\nto prepare for these illustrous guests [and] Henry\nLowndes [and] Lish are coming out for supper [and] bringing the turkey\n[End Page 5]\nhe shot for me and eight quail as well.\nI found this verse to-night in a book- for you\n\"Though my love be further away from me\nThan the east from the west or the day\nfrom the night,\nI have turned my face to his dwelling-place,\nand I bid him good-night, \"Goodnight,\"\nOh moon shine first on my lips and then \ngo shine on the forehead of him I love!\nHe will dream perchance that an angel's wing\nHas quivered his bow above-\nBut thou Oh wind! lay close on his lips\nThe kisses thou hast in thy flight,\nand he will stir in his sleep, wake\nand wisper- \"My heart- good night.\"\nGood- night my heaven eyes\nthe wind, and the moon, and the waves\nbring you all my love all the time\nI shall dream we are holding each other\nin our arms to-night-\nYour Gertie-\n[End Page 6]"
