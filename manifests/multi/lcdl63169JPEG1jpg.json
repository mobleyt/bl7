      "value": "[Page One]\nWashington\n14th Jan 1846\nMy dear sir,\nI have been inactive, \nbut not indifferent in reference to the \nMexican War. On the contrary, I have \nbeen directing my attention closely to it, \nwhile waiting for developments, in order \nto enable me to determine on my course. \nWhen the time comes, when I can move\nwith effect, I shall take the course, which\nduty may prescribe, that is the course, \nwhich, in my opinion, is best calculated \nto extricate the country from the diffi\nculties and dangers, which surrounds\nit.\nIt is at present in a sad condition \nNever before was the prospect so gloomy. \nBoth parties are distracted and [derided?]; and \nboth without confidence in the admin\nistration. The determination seems to \nbe to push the war with [illegible], as far as \nwords are concerned and voting of men; but \nI see no disportation to raise the means \nfor sustaining the war, unless, indeed, by \n[Page Two]\n[scratched through] laying additional duties; that is \nby undoing the reduction of last [illegible] \nin whole or part to add to our difficul\nties, abolition is received in a new and \nmore dangerous form. It seems to be \nresolved on by both parties of the North, \nthat no part of the country to be agressed\nby the war shall be for the benefit of \nthe South. They are very willing that our \nblood and treasury shall be expended\nfully in the war to acquire the victory, not \nfor the common good, but as the means \nof assailling and suing us. We are to be \nmade to dig our own grave.\nTherefore my worst anticipations in reference \nto the war would seem to be in a fair \nway to be realized. It dropt a curtain\nbetween me and the future, but as I told \nmy friends at the time, I could not penetrate\nnor am I un able. I see no way to [illegible]\ncite the country from impending calamities \nbut by turning the war from an offensive to \na defensive one, by holding what we have \ngot, or rather so much as would amply in-\n[illegible] us; and say to Mexico that we are \n[Page Three]\nready to treat when she is and to settle differences on\njust and liberal terms, but if she is not that we \nare content to hold which we have got. A\nline might be taken, which would cover [an] ample \ncontent to [illegible] us fully, that could be defended \nat our expense, [scratched through] and by a force not much \ngreater, than our weaponry fence establishment.\nI shall take some early opportunity to explain \nmy views. I know not whether they will pre\nvail or not; but if they should not, you may\nregard the war as only just begun; that its \nend is uncertain, and that should it be protested\nwhich would be probable, no man can tell \nwhat will come.\nIn the meantime our [papers?] should \nbe cautious and wait developments here, ex-\ncept as to the slave aspect of the subject. Or \nthat, they should speak out [illegible] and \nboldly. Our nations here should be \ncheered by their sustaining. Ten days or\ntwo weeks will disclose much.\nYou may show this to such prudent friends\nas you may think proper.\nTruly\nJ.[John] C.[Caldwell] Calhoun\nH.[Henry] W.[Workman] Conner Sr."
