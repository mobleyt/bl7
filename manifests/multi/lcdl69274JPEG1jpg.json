      "value": "May 7, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nI have dated this letter the seventh because it will\nbe mailed then, but I am writing it on the evening of the sixth\nin my apartment. It is as hot and as smelly as a bear pit with\nthe black out curtains shut and the perspiration is streaming down\nmy body. It is difficult to know whtehr it is better to go outside\nand sit in the darkness and realtive coolness and be unable to\nread or to sit insdie in a hemetically sealed room and suffer.\nPerhaps if one read books about the artic and looked at pictures \nof ships encased in ice it would help. Soon you will be enveloped\nin the heat of Washington vith that heavy damp depressing air\nthat saps ones vitality and tunrs every movement into a shower\nof perspiration. I do hope you will be able to escape it\nsomehow, either by becoming a Waac or obtaining a position abroad\nor at least out of that torrid city.\nI received a letter from Miss Finucan in which she\nsaid she did not understand why I had not received her letters\nwith my accounts and that they must have been lost. She also\nsaid that she was houndlng Mr Anderson to make out my income tax,\nstatement. Considering that he had the federal tax made out from\nthe Guaranty Trust income statement for the Federal Government\nI cannot understand what he is doing. It recalls t he slothfulness\nof the South and their habit of going fishing when there is work\nto be done. When you speak of living in tha country on a farm\nafter the war I have my doubts. It is very difficult to know\nwhat will happen and I think only time will be able to solve the\nproblem. There will be the matter of xxxxxx finance, the question\nof whether one wishes to live in the country away from people without\ngoing to pieces mentaly, and the problem of the daily unproductive\ngrind of a farm without any of the equ lizing pleasures that are\nobtainable in other forms of life. Still I must admit that the\nsight of a plowed field gives me a thrill, and the cane growing in\nstraight lines , marching down the black soil is very exciting.\nMorris has been feeling very badly for the past two weeks\nand has gone to bed as soon as we reached home. As a resutt he has\nbeen getting worse. Tonight I dragged him out surfboarding and\nstarted him off on vitamins again which I found out he had dropped\nwhen he was feeling well. xxxxxxx Now he is in bed reading and\nfeeling a great deal better so I think the worst is past and that\nhs will soon be feeling hale and happy again.\n[End Page 1]\nThe waves were enormous this evening. Duke Kahanmoko was out\non his Australian surf boat, a tiny thing th t looks l ke a\nKyak. He was marvellous, starting himself off with a paddle and\nthen leaping to his feet the picture of grace and south sea island\ncharm as he rode the crested foamers in. I caught one wave, a\nmonster and was slid ng down its side at a terrif_ic rate of speed\nthe bow going pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat as it bounced along, the edge\nof the board cutting the water making a ho[l]low whishing sound[,]when\nsuddenly in fron[T] [scratched through] not more than four feet apart I saw two boards\nwith men on them. It was to late to dive into the water and\nlet my board jump them so I prayed to God and tried so steer between.\nIn a smother of spray and roaring xxxxx wave I zipped between\nwith only a half caught glimpse of their wide eyed frightened\nfaces. I couldnot have missed either of them by more than six inches\nand had I hit going at that speed I certainly would have killed\nsomeone. I was so xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx after I had\npassed that I fell off and did not dare come up for at least half\na minute in fear of having hit xxxxxxx.them with the tail of the\nboard which veered at the last moment as unintenionaly I threw\nmy weigh to one side.\nRoddy Wanamaker gave a cocktail party at the officers\nclub this afternobn and very kindly asked us, but we we e so late\nleaving the office, and felt so dirty that we did not go. Anyway\nthere is something so futile about the idea of a coctail party\nat the officers club, there being nothing to do but get drunk with\nno place to go and only the next days work looming ahead like the .\nsword of fate ready to fall at eight all hang over or no hang over.\nSwimming and surfing are the only things that are fun and Morris\nand I have only been to the officers club four times since we have\nbeen out here, and that waseight months on the first of may.\nMuch water has run over and under the bridge since than and I feel\nI have forgotten a great deal and possibly learned a very little,\nif any,,about human nature and my job. Tennis is a thing of the\npast, a golf club would be as strange to my hands as a pair of\nreins. and my chief ambition is to lie down and sleep for twenty\nfour hours without ever waking up.\nThe af[r]ican war seems to be going better, but in my\nown mind I do not confuse the African war and its winning with\nthe war on the continent and the defeat of Germany. The two are\nyears apart. While, the Pacific war is only in its infancy.\nHqwever by 1947 we should be well on our way to vicotry.\nGoodbye dear, I send you all my love.\nSidney Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
