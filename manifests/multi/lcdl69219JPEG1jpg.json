      "value": "Copy\noriginal to London\nJuly 28, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nThe mystery thickens and I am more thrilled and\nexcited than ever. This departure of yours is as I said\nbefore[,]better than any detective sotry. I rushed home from\nthe office on Monday to receive your telephone call and\nfound your cable under the door, saying that you had postponed\nit. As this came on top of the news of Mussolinis resignation\nI judged that the two were connected somhow. I should\nthink that you would be nervous as a fiddle trying to find\nout whether you are to go or not. The idea of the slow\ntransportation is firghtful. Why you can become an old\nwomen before you ever arrive. This I do know. You will\nundoubtly be kept in Washington until the hot weather is\npassed and will arrive in your new post just in time for the\nbad winter weather. In other words it will be so arranged\nby fate that you will get the worst of both places. Could'nt\nyou arrange it so that you go up and stay with the children\nat Watch Hill until the Goverment ma es up its mind. There\nis no use sweating out the last of your energy in Washington\nif you are leaving it. You probably need a rest very badly,\nand I know the children would love to see you if it is at\nall possible to go up.. Your discripti n of BO Bo charms me so\nth t I have re[a]d it sev ral times. she must be the cutiest\nth ng in existence and I am terribly sorry that I will miss\nseeing herx during these wonderful years when she is chubby\nand huggable. It is wonderful that Landine is becoming free\nand easy. Nothing you ever have done with the children pleased\nme as much as your dismissing Madmofselle. I felt that if she\nwas with Landine two more years the child would be ruined beyo-\nnd help. A few years with Miss Evans, and making her own bedx\netc. will work wonders.\nMorris and I and Johnny Lee went to the Outrigger\nClub for a swim and dinner tonight. It is the first time I\nhave been there for at least two weeks. It was very gay\nas a new law has been passed that you can drink until seven\noclock at all bars and clubs. Of co[u]rse the world was taking\nadvantage of this fact as the law only went into effect\nlast night. I wish I could tell you that we had girls with us\nand were the gayest of all. However it is the same old\nstory. We had dinner, finished, Morris arose and said lets\ngo to the movies. Johhny w[A]s a little upset and suggested\nwatching the dancing, but yielded when Morris said he w[A]s going\nto the mov[i]es and I said I w[A]s comming home to write to you.\nYou menti[o]ned in your last letter that I never told you about\ngo[i]ng to the Marxs for a Luau. If you will look back\nthrough your letters you will see that I listed several times\n[End Page 1]\nthe places that I have been to dinner.\nOnce to the Marxs\nTwice to the Moddys\nOnce to the Wilders\nOnce to Gregg Merrils.\nOnce to that old Colonel,a friend of Olives, I have forgotte\nhis name\nOnce to Duke Kahanmoku\nBut sweetheart even if I don't remember to tell you, what is\nthere wrong about that. At thirty nine one should be able to\ngo out to dinner without sitting down and immediately reporting\nit to ones wife.\nI played tennis with Morris again yesteeday, and we\nboth loved it. It is an entirely different form of exercise\nfrom swimming and leaves you with a wonderful rested[,]exercised\nfeeling. Swimming on the other hand leaves you pouped andpl yed\nout. I think this is due to the warm water and also to the\nfact that if you lie in et r for a long time as you do on\na s rboard it relaxes your muscles to a point where their\nability to contract is gone. I have always felt like a limp\nrag after swimming but after tennis and a shower it is almost\nlike old times.\nIt has become very arm here now and we work without\nties and everyones shirt is wringing wet druing theday. This\nof course is an old story to you who have been laboring in\nterr fic heat for months but it is so unusal out ehre that\nwe all talk of it. I do not re lly su pose the temperature\nchanges very much but we re so spoiled by the climate and\nbeauty of the place that little things are noticed.\nI wish Icould be optomistic about the fut re of the\nwar. You cannot believe wh t yo read in the papers and maga-\nzines. According to them Jap ships ndplanes go down by the\nthousands, their fight[ers]are swept formt he f ce of the e rth\nand noth ng happens to our equipment or warriors. And you\nknow M ssolini r signing does not necess rily mean that Italy\nwill quit. She may count on our never intending to invade her\nbut rather to push up the Adriatic, bypassing her land. In this\ncase she has nothing to gain by surrending and everything togain\nby remaining in the war. However the resignation is a boon\nto one class of people, the commentators. They are never off\nthe radio with their speculations, prophsies and warnings.\nThey are race unto themselves, half Gen[e]rals, Admirals, Fianances\nwelded together with the essence of the common people.\nKatherine wrote me that you had been there and how\nmuch she had loved seeing you. She described how you had a \nmint julep before dinner and then tennis next day and it made\nme very homesick for th[A]t last wonderful week end when the entire\nfamily was un ted and we laughed so at Morris dragging Nancy\nbehind in the little wagon and Armant and Fifi pedalling like\nmad to the village and returning exhausted.\n[End Page 2]\nYou and I w lked and played tennis together, As you\ndescribed we slept in the room overlooking the river and\ncame down very l te for breakfast Sunday morning, and as\nI remember we had rasberries and thick cream and all sorts of \ngood things. Katherine is wonderful to keep theplace\ngoing, and I bet she works her guests to the bone in payment f\nfor food and lodging.\nGoodbye sweetheart, let me know where you are\nand what your plans are. W[i]th all my love.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 3]"
