  "description": "Anita Pollitzer and Elie Edson at Muir Woods, 1929. On back on photograph: “To Mrs. Pollitzer:  With love for her birthday, March 5th, 1930, we send this souvenir of one of our    happiest days in California, when we played, as little children in fairy stories,  alone in the Muir Woods, a glorious grove of Red Wood Trees – one thousand years old! Beneath our feet the dead leaves of many, many generations made a    carpet of exquisite springy softness. The sunlight above could hardly find its way down to us through the thick foliage and so to get these photographs, we faced a long exposure of several minutes, scarcely daring to breathe! Elie.” Also, in pencil “#4 Dec. 22 ’29.” Photograph was taken by “F. Ransome, fotographer at Mt. Tamalpais and Muir Woods, California 5701 Vallejo St., N.W. Cor. Stanford    Ave. Oakland, Cal.” Black and white photograph.",
