      "value": "Philadelphia. Oct. 12./59. My dear Mr Barnwell. I duly received Your letter with its Enclosure, which Elizabeth agrees with me in thinking has the ring [of?] the genuine poetical [illegible]: though we regret that the Poet Should have been subjected to the same misconstruction that has in other cases attended the possession of the faculty divine. I am glad that you have had for the most part such pleasant weather, & I hope Mrs Barnwell has acquired a relish for northern life in the agreeable Society & Surroundings of Cambridge. I observe by the papers that Professor Agassiz is in Europe [End Page 1] So that You will miss seeing him. By the bye, Mr Binney of this city has just published a book upon the Subject of Washingtons Farewell Address in which he Controverts the Conclusions of Mr Sparks as to its authorship. If You Should have any curiosity to Examine this question, I will procure the book for You when You come on. We were much pleased to hear that Your Cough was better, & that Dr [Wyman?] had given a favorable opinion as to the State of Your lungs. If You will write me a day or two in advance of Your arrival in Philadelphia I will meet You at the wharf, & accompany You to our little box in Germantown. I am about leaving for the train, [End Page 2] And with Kind regards to Mrs Barnwell, I remain, Very Truly Yours, Henry Flanders. [End Page 3] W.H.W. Barnwell Esq. Cambridge. Mass. Envelope"
