      "value": "original to Watch\nHill\nCopy\n34\nAugust 13, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nYour heavenly letter of August 7th. arrived today\nwith all the news of your doings. I am certain y u will\nfeel much better at Watch Hill in the sunshine and taking\na certain amount of exercise. It is the type of life you have\nalways liked and the one at which you feel the best.\nThe children sound very sweet. I wish I could see\nthem together. They must be very brown and healthy, while your\ndescription of Honey makes me want to take him in my arms and\ngive him a great big hug. He must feel that life at last is giv\ning him a wonderful time and he probably wonders how long it will\nlast. He is really such a sweet dog that I hope there will\nbe a great deal of happiness in store for him and not to\nmuch loneliness and kennels.\nPlease have Landine use our old cure for poison\nIvy the only one we ever found worked wonders within twenty\nfour hours. Do you remember[,]you rub the blisters until they\nbreak with a three per cent solution of postassium permaganate.\nRub it well into the infection and it disappears almost overnight.\nIt stopped the irritation with you any number of times when it\nseemed as if you were c tching it, and I know that it is so\nmuch better than that calcimine solution that does nothing\nbut cover your face up with gue.\nMorris returned tonight from his cruise an was very\nglad to be in his room. He h wever had had a c bin to sleep in\nand had spent the greater part of t_he day lying down and reading[,]\nvery unlike my having to pace the deck. However heagreeed with\nme that the bor_edom is terrific, the absolut[e]lack of anything\nto do drives one nuts. We feel we are very lucky in our present\njobs and hope that nothing changes them. I cannot transfer to\nYour Business because as I told you in a previous letter all\nrequest for l ave and transfer will be looked upon with suspicious\nand it will be assumed that the offcer so requesting is\ntrying to avoid his duty. So say the powers that be in a written\nletter. The great difference is that here you have a military\ngovernment. For example Morris left the car parked in the\nwrong place before he left on his trip. We got a ticket and I\nrang up and asked if we could pay the fine by check as it was\nimpossible to come in due to my duties. The answer was that\nMorris was to appear before the military court an his return\nand no one else would do and no one else could pay the fine.\nHe appears before a colonel whocan put any sentence on him that\nhe wishes. Military law is entirely different from civilian\nand you cannot realize the difference until you [L]ive under it.\n[End Page 1]\nWe cooked a wonderful dinner of canned chicken\na la king and birdseye xxxx lima beans. It was very good and\nMorris said far tastier than the wretched fresh food they tried\ntoserve him on board the ship. It was a relief to have that old\ngodd metal[L]ic t[A]ste in his mouth again he said, and to know\nthat it came straight from the cannery to him w thout lying\nopen and subject to the hands of dirty cooks and mess boys.\nThe night before his return I stayed out at cincpac\nand played tennisxwith some of the boys from the office and then\nwhnt to the movie there. F rst the Cincpac me[s]s was delightful.\nEverything was spotless and the silver and linen looked so nice\nthat I wanted to just look at it. I had forgotten that things\ncould be so clean. The meal was served quickly and well by\nmess men in newly starched jackets and the conversation at the\ntable was interesting and amusing. Afterwards we went to the\nCincpac movies and saw Leslie Howard in th story of the life\nof Mitchell the man who invented the spitf[i]re. It was\nthrilling from the point of view th t you saw this inventor\ngiving his life and knowing that he was giving it through\noverwork in order that the spitfire might be ready for the\nba[t]tle of Britain that he knew was comming. There was a wonderful\ns[c]en[e]where he walked into the British Vivkers Co after leaving his\ndoctor who had just told him that he could not live more than\nei[g]ht months if he did not go and take a years rest. The\nChariman of Vickers said to him \"Mitchell we must have t he best\nfighter in the world and we must have it within a year that is\nall the time we c n give you\". The inventor repeplied\n\"Gentlemen you will have it within eight months that is all the \ntime I can give you.\" The play en_dedwith Churchills speech\n\"never xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx have so many owed so much to so\nfew\".\nThen there was a movie about the lost tre[a]sure of the\nIncas that was absolutely astxounding. A[p]parently since the x\ntime of [C]ortes this treasure has been discovered four times and\neach time the discovere returned to civilization only to die\nspeechless with some age old golden work in his hand. They show\nyou in the movie where the supposed entrance is to this\ntreasure. It is called the eagels nest. But no one who has ever\ngone into that entrance has ever come out. Only the four men who\nsomeoXhow stumbled on it return[ed]to civilization but die[d] before\nthey could tell where they had foundit.\nFat Face is furious because he is apartment bo[u]nd and\ncannot go to the movies. Now that we live in this pest district\nour movements are so confined that I am thinking of leaving\nif they will let us until the epedemic breaks.\nGoodbye sweetheart, all my love. You had better write\nto the National City Bank in London, The american Embassy, and\nthe River club for mail I have sent there.\n[End Page 2]"
