      "value": "Cheraw 10 Sep 1863 Dear Brother Since my last I have not been favoured with any of yours. The incidents of war, with the for knocking at the portals of the city, are now so interesting I presume you have but little time to devote as bearer. Fortunately the shelling of the city is suspended, the repose of its inhabitants may for awhile be more calm. Father is very uneasy about sister Anna, and wishes to know your purpose as to her return home. It may be too inconvenient for you to go for her if so, some opportunity might be sought after to that goal. I understand Miss Drake came on [illegible] last week. You will have noticed I have offered for sale the Real Est of Bro James -- for the dwelling I have a bid of 8000$ from Mr? Ingraham, it may bring more. On Sunday last I had a letter from Sr Augusta asking that the dwelling be [illegible] in -- and that she wrote by advice. Ordinarily the property would be considered a good investment but with the debts of Est unpaid I think the sale advisable and so wrote to her, especially as it will bring full double the price of former times. There are for sale here yet the Bright? place on Church it sold for 6000$ the [Illegible] house adjoining 5000 and a small house formally Mr Graffts for 1800 and some few others. Mrs Fengas? is with us -- all are quite well and join in much love, asking your prayers I am ever your affec Bro F. Lynch Mond 11 Miss Drake arrd last night. This morning a letter was recd from Sister Anna, she was quite well and was looking for you soon -- all well[End Page 1] The last news from Fort Sumter sustains us [illegible] F.L.[End Page 2]"
