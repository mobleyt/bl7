      "value": "Madame Lynch JMJ Ursuline Convent Columbia SC. Sunday 26th June 1859 My Dearest Brother Before I begin to give you an account of how I spent my feast day, let me thank you most sincerely for your congratulations, still more for your prayers and offerings. I expected you to come that morning but had no reason to do so I am sure. Did you remember that you arrived in Brown County on the fest of St John the Baptist last year? Our sisters imitated the examples they had seen elsewhere and put themselves to a great deal of trouble, especially the novices. They requested me to let them keep it on Corpus Christi, since on that day we should have no school, and to let the boarders have recreation on Friday evening-I did so and was banished from the noviciate during the preparations-Sr Raymond, who is foremost at every thing, scrubbed the floor together with the Cincinnati sisters-the rest washed the windows. About ten OClock next morning I was invited into the noviciate, where all assembled to wish me a happy feast-a carpet strewn In margin: and all are in bed but myself-Did I mention a parcel left for us in New York at _ and sent by Sister Angela to Sister Ursula? Please pray for your own sister Ellen Sr Baptista Sup We are already anticipating our annual retreat which we purpose entering on the 6th of Aug DV and coming out on the feast of the Assumption on the same day having Sister Illegible's profession and Sister Rose's reception. I hope you will secure a Jesuit Father for us. How is Father illegible represent the illegible of Columbia. I would wish such a priest or Bishop if illegible recommends. [End Page 1] with flowers was laid for me to walk upon and led to a throne erected upon which was a \"chair of state\" nicely decorated. At either side was a table, the one laden with refreshments-the other, with little offerings from the sisters, either pious pictures, the work of their hands, or some little treasure of which they had deprived themselves. Scarcely was I seated when Sister Eliza (whose simplicity I admired) came forward and read a complimentary address, written in blank verse by Sister Raymond and herself-to which I made a sort of reply in plain prose. Then came the congratulations and kiss of peace given by each in her rank after which the novices served the refreshments-. The day passed off as happily to every one else as it did to myself seemingly and we blessed God for this goodness to us. On Friday morning we held our examinations as usual and in the afternoon I was excluded from the back parlor by the children and their kind mistresses who spared no pains to carry our their plans. The performance of the evening lasted from seven oclock until nine, and the tableaux were as prettily got up, as in Brown County. I wish you could have witnessed them-then a song composed by Sr Raymond was sung in my honor(!) after which, Eliza Reordan? made me a very flattering address in the name of her illegible to which, of course I as the papers say, responded-The children then enjoyed their \"bon bons.\" I forgot to say that [End Page 2] the sisters had a tableau the night before, in which Sr Rose was \"Mother Superior\" Sister Raymond and Sr Eliza were white veiled novices. I was very much pleased to see such an amiable and cheerful spirit among them all and had Anna with us a great part of the time-she seemed to be quite amused. Our Lord, who watches over me and knows how good humiliation is for me, sent me a very good one, in the midst of all this, thro' John-who came after Anna and was seen by our Srs in a condition most painful for us to witness. This evening he and Anna called for the first time since, when he was quite well, but annoyed with me-and I don't blame him. Today I received a letter, from Mother Theresa, who tells me that she will have her \"distribution on the 14th, consequently we will have ours on the 16th and under the protection of \"Our Lady of Mt. Carmel.\" It's being Saturday makes no difference to us. I do not think we will send cards to any person this year. I think more prudent for various reasons (tho' you may have them printed) and you can give as many verbal invitations as you like-we will have the children to invite their parents and in this follow the Brown County custom. Mother Superior says she never invites any one, therefore no one can take offense. We have begun a Novena to the \"Sacred Heart\" my dearest Brother in which you and your intentions have a very large share, I will also offer [End Page 3] Holy Communion for the same intention. I am very much afraid you are giving yourself a great deal of anxiety and trouble to get the means required for purchasing a convent for us and I would not have you suffer five minutes on our account. You told me to trust in the good providence of God, and so I do. The good disposition of our Sisters too, in that regard, is a great support to me-today, when at recreation we were planning for the erection of a chapel-I said if you allowed me, I would beg thro' the streets of Columbia for means to accomplish our designs and three of the Postulants begged as a favor, that they might share in the humiliation. I feel tempted to ask your permission to initiate our Sisters of St Louis in that way, after the Distribution, perhaps such an act of public humiliation, might bring a blessing on the house and do much good. I fear our Distribution this year will be too trifling a thing to ask persons of distinction to, the greater number of the children being so small and the house so unfit. Should you not visit us before the 16th of July, I will tell you that it will terminate with a short address to you, which you will have the goodness to make some reply to and give your Episcopal benediction to this mustard seed, this tiny nut, which is we trust to germinate and yield a hundred fold. I hope Eliza will soon return, I think John misses her a good deal-Anna too speaks of returning to Cheraw-I wish you would bring Revd. Dr. Cocoran and Mr. Sullivan up to the Distribution. Mr DeBuihl?, not yet returned, but expected every day. A man who lives next door to Mrs Bauskett, called and requested John to buy his place, saying he thought the next property could be got too-a most eligible situation I am told by him if only enough of ground. We are awakened at all hours, by the inmates of the establishments near us-are you tired reading this yet? Well, goodnight, it is past ten[End Page 4]"
