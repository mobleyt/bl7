      "value": "Confidential Savannah Jany 23 1840 Rev & Dear Sir, I was called upon today by Mr. Fielding, one of the Romanish priests located here, who wished to know whether you had, [illegible] in conversation or by letter, communicated to me his having applied to you some time ago for information on certain points, in reference to which his mind appears to be unsettled. I, of course, replied that you had not. He then proceeded to make enquiry respecting the measures necessary to be pursued in making such a change as he contemplates. As I understood him to say that three years have elapsed since he first consulted you, and it seems to me rather strange that he should have delayed so long to take the proposed step, and moreover speaks of deferring any definite action until the latter part of March next, I have deemed it advisable to confer with you on his case, in order that I may know what course to pursue in relation to it. you will oblige me, therefore, by giving me, at your earliest[End Page 1] convenience, any information which you may have, or any opinion you may entertain as to the expedience or inexpediency of encouraging his application. With very great regard. I remain your friend & bro. Ed. Neufville [End Page 2] Rev E Neufville Jan 23d 1840 inquiring as to the application of Rev Mr. Fielding for admission to Pro. E. Church Ansd &lt;SAVANNAH GA JAN 24&gt; Rev. W.H. Barnwell Charleston S.C. [End Page 3]"
