      "value": "Chillicothe 8 Feb. 1863\n\nDear Niece\n\nI am glad you received the two\npapers I sent you. Your verses were mislaid for a con-\nsiderable time, otherwise they would have been\npublished long before. The reason why my letter to\nthe editor of the crisis was published [without?] name is that a year\nbefore I wrote to him in words of equal encour-\nagement, but although he published my letter,\nhe abstained from inserting my name, remark-\ning that he regretted that he did not feel author-\nized to give it; although if he were at liberty\nto do so, \"it would be of great advantage to\nthem, inasmuch as the author enjoyed a nati-\nonal reputation.\" In a postscript to my letter\nthis year therefore, I gave him full liberty\nto publish with my name.- But I am total-\nly at a loss to know the meaning of your Mo-\nther, when she says that there are several num-\nbers of my articles which I have never furn-\nished her with, and which she desires I\n\n[End page 1]\n\nshould supply her with, in order to complete her\nset. Most assuredly I have either given with my\nown hands, or sent to her every one of the [articles?],\nand she has acknowledged the receipt of every\none. The last eight I gave her with my own\nhand in October, the few preceding, I gave her\nin the October preceding, and the two first were\nsent to her and the receipt of them was ack-\nnowledged by letter. This complete the 14 Nos\nand if any are missing, she must have mis-\nlaid, or lent them to some one. The two articles which\nwere published in Cincinnati prior to this series, I did not\nsend, because I had but one copy of each.\nSell your Aunt Angelina that I received her let-\nter a few days ago, and the linen the day be-\nfore the date of her letter. As it turned out, it\ncame all in time, and I am only sorry I gave\nher so much trouble.\n\nI have not been able to find the paper contain-\ning the details of the condition of Camp Chose,\nor I would send it to you; but the condition\nof all is the same. That at Louisville it is\neven said to be much worse.\n\nBut I have forgotten to mention, that I am\nnow belonging under an ugly disease of the\nthroat; what is termed [illegible]; so that it is\nwith great difficulty that I swallow. The\n\n[End page 2]\n\nremedy is a very simple one however; it consists\nin introducing the [bougie?] down the whole \n[illegible] of the esophagus [nine [illegible]] repeatedly\nwhen the stricture is [illegible]. But the incon-\nvenience in the mean time is very great, and\neven painful. You might suppose, that the\nintroduction of the bougie, would itself\nbe painful. Not so however, strange as it may\nseem for the diameter is nearly the same as\nmy little finger.\n\nI am glad to hear you speak of the many fine\ntraits of character, you find in Stewart. He\nwill most assuredly grow up to be a most ex-\ncellent, and intelligent man. I hope you\nhave read to him the eight articles I\nleft with your Mother last fall. I think [illegible]\nwill be listened to by him with great eager-\nness, and earnestness, and will [contribute?] to\nto confirm the great change which has\ntaken place in his political sentiments.\nAnd here let me request that your Mother\nwill not cut out my articles; but preserve\nthem as I gave them.\n\nNothing need be said of the war: the defeats\nand disasters of the abolition army have\nbeen so [illegible]; and the victories\nof the Confederates, so repeated, and tri-\numphant; that every thing may now be consi-\ndered as settled.\n\n[Illegible] your affect. Uncle,\nFrederick Grimke\n\n[End page 3]\n\nWinter commenced on the 2d of this month.\n\n[To:] Mrs [Madeline?] Haskell\nPerth Amboy\nNew Jersey\n\n[Postmarked:] Chillicothe, Feb 9 \n\n[End page 4]"
