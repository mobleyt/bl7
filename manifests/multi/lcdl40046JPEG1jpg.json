      "value": "It would be well for us all to remember that the Judgment Seat of Christ not the words merely but the spirit of our writings have to undergo a stern censorship. Laurel Bay April 18th 1844 My dear friend-- I sent you by Mr. Fielding several columns of Editorial Matter for the next number of the Paper, but don't know whether he was to reach Charleston before Saturday. This however as well as that will be I suppose in time for Monday morning. The programme of the next No. called for a piece under the head of \"Historical,\" entitled Wickliffe which was to have been taken from the Episcopal Recorder as [illegible] from the Christian Guardian but was not out in time. You can have put in its place, the Editorial matter here sent. Let it all go in, if there is room for it. Let the order be- 1st [Mr?] Barnes & the Prayer Brook - 2nd The True Catholic & the Unity of the Church- 3d Church [illegible] in the settlements- 4th [illegible] &c &c. 5th The Prerogative of the Bishop & the Rights of the [illegible]- 6th Editorial [illegible]. Then Ecclesiastical Intelligence &c &c [End Page 1] I will probably send much of that for the 24th No-- which is to be out May 2nd by the steamboat next Monday. For the No. after I expect God willing to be in Town--We are all well. God be with you. Give my love to all. Your friend & brother W.H. Barnwell <BEAUFORT APRIL 19 SC> <PAID> Chas. S. DeSaussure Esq. Charleston So. Ca. Do say plainly to Mr. Walker in my name, that the Paper must positively be printed more correctly. I cannot bear it longer. If the fault be in my hand-writing--it shall be amended--but more correctly printed the Paper must positively be. WHB [End Page 2]"
