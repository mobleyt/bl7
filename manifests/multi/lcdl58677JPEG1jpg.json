      "value": "Kerrison\"s  Department Store  260-262 King St. around to Hase  Charleston 7 South Carolina  Juy 17, 1944  Mr. Jack Krawcheck, Chairman  Merchants Committee on King St. Parking,  313 King Street,  Charleston 7, S. C.  Dear Jack:  In answer to your questionnaire, which was eft with me  several days ago, regarding traffic contro and Automobile parking in our  retai district, I am gad to give you my reaction as follows.  First of a, I do not think that any inteigent consideration can be given to this problem during this period of time when we have  so many thousand Additional citizens in our community. The city has undergone rapid explansion, and whether this increase in population will be maintained or whether we ose a considerable portion of it will have a marked  bearing on a proper consideration of this subject. Therefore, I fee that  any amount of time expended at this period in studying this problem would  be time, effort and money wasted.  Over a period of fifteen years a great many things have  been done to reieve the congested traffic in our down town shopping area.  To my knowedge, during that period of time, there have been opened nine  parking areas in the down town district and one in the up town district.  These areas accomodate a thousand automobies with a turnover of four times  a day, making four thousand spaces avaiable for parking. As the need increases many of the parking areas will be converted into ramp garages  which will increase the parking three or four times its present capacity.  I would be very strenuousy opposed to the acquisition by  the city of any area to be used for parking, as this would be an attempt  on the part of the city to enter into a business venture with tax payers  money, which is contrary to our principes of free enterprises, and it  is exacty what we are a fighting against in the way of government in  business.  The proposa to eiminate parking on King Street is good  and should be done to accomodate a continua flow of traffic through the  retai district.  with kind personal regards, I beg to remain  Very truy yours, Edwin Pounot EHP,Jr:e"
