      "value": "18\nApril 13th\nI recieved your cable this morning asking for the source of that runour.\nI was unable to wire who the person was who originated the tale but I\nshall endevour to find out. Sonny Whitney told it as an amusing funny story- suppos-\nsedly to give onea laugh. I did not think that sort of story was a very good \none to float around]but as 1 told you it was hard to refute not having a \nglimmer of an idea what it was all about. The lord only knows who the story is real\nabout- probably an other guy whom it happened to,or perhaps its a fabrication\nof the mind and has no basis even about an other fellow. I have hover heard 5\nof a Legendre being rude 1n.my lifqaand was sure that was no truth in any of it. 1\nIf I find out who started it shal let yop know. I shall work on Sonny to toll me\nHe probably will refuse to tell me but I shall ceratinly ask.\nI dont believe you should worry about it as I dont believe it was meant as a mal\nioious story. I dont know anyone else who has ever spoken of it, and there was _\nonly Sonny his wife Eleanor and myself at the time listening. Is n't it amazing\nhow tw1sted,and redicu1ous,and frightful stor1es.can be concocted whsich have no\nfoundation whatso ever. I think you should not give it an other thought because\n my fast letter how that Commander Jelky had told me what swell  \nreports he had heard about you in the Navy Department and what knockouts you both\nmust be. I was so proud gf you, and wrote you about it.\nI loved your letter this morning mailed the Vth- that arrived so fast too.\nYour wonderful description of evening in the tropics, the stlas, the sof air,\nthe rustling of the plam leaves. My darling 'how love that setting. Howivould love\nto be there beside you drinlcrlng it all in, holding; you tight, loving under those stmi\n- that moon- those palms. I do love that tropical softness so much- that lovely\npicture you describe. I can see it and almost feel it, I know that heavenly\nevening when the heat of day is passed and everything; is so still and yet so alive\n- its beautiful. The perfect spot for you and me to love in.I do hope we can _\nlive that sort of thing together some day, and I hope that day is not too far off.\nThere is nothing; in the world equal to salt water and sunshine. I have always l\nloved it more than anything els? and I would love it believe me this second instead\nof this city existence, this fi thy Q bldg, the pavements, etc. It is spring\nand one realizes how beautiful it would be in the country, instead,,you see a plum\ntree in bloom in some ones back yard, a blue bird on a brick wall, yellow dafadils\nsprouting; against a i'ence.An effort of grass and flowers to show they are alive\nand want to bloom,but somehow all that show of spring life is so restricted, so\npuney and pathetic. The trees struggle for life ln a feted City atmosphere of\nbasses and taxis, cement and brick. It makes one long for open country, rolling\nhills, vegetable gardens, woods and fresh air. Well as you say Darling, this _all '_\ncant last forever. Someday you and I will breath in the country again. We will swim\nin the ocean together, we will lye on sand beaches in the sun, and leave the strife\nand pettiness of life behind us. I wish I knew where we will do all this. Have you\ndecided?\nAs a bycicled down this morning to the office I passed Col Don- walking. He\nasked me how I was comming with the WAACS. I told him I was not elegible as I had\nchildren under 14 -He said he would have this waved and get me in it. God only knows\n[End Page 1]\n2\nwhat to do. I think he wants to have me become a WAAS officer. I am not too\nsure if this is a correct move or not. I dont know if I could get through\nOfficers school if I d1d'get sent. I dont know if I have had sufficient education.\nI dont know if? uld ast through it or get flunked. I would hate to join and .\nfind myself only priv t He wants me fo do it up brown and come back here an\nofficer. He says he wil aarantee that will work for him for the duration and\nnot for the WAACS That h will have me assigned to O.S.S. and then once in uniform\nhe can send me anywherelaad that I c an chose where I want t go and he will back\nme. They need personal ab cad terribly in our outfit: Somanyspots want and need\nworkers, that I have a chgce to chose which country prefer. We operate in an\nawful lot of countries. e work is d--- interesting and ofcourse doubly so when\nin the fieldand not in Washington. I dont know what to do. I cant get over with\nout a un1form,and it does not look as though Mrs Hubby was willing to give us a\nprovurement of officers the way the army does for the men. What do you thinkil\nshould do?\nI wonder if there is going; to be a chance of youvbeing transfered to '\nthe Atlantic and away from the Pacific- does it seem possible? Gee that would be\nwonderful. The .Taps seem to be picking up again out in New Guinea and it looks like\nan other big; push out there. Europe is working out so much better. I really believe\nNorth Africa will be over verry soon, its going marvelously now.\nI amsending my secretary Miss Pearson and her pal Mrs Baumer to N.Y.C.\nthis corminpg weekend . hey have never been and are going 'to enjoy it so much. I\nhave bought them seats to Ethel Merman's show and also for the Circus at Madison\nSquare ,and I think they will have a swell time. They both work like smoke and are\nthe most willing pair in the world, good natured and 1ndustious.I am very lucky to\nhave them. The volume of work increases daily and we all do more than we have ever\ndone before. Not a minute to breathe or go to the Cafeteria for a cogia cola.\n_ I am lunching to-day at a Foxcroft reunion luncheon which I bet will be\nfunny. I shall finish this letter to you when I come back so 1 can tell you aboutit.\nLATER-\n' The lunch was most impressive. Held at the Sulgrave Club. There must have\nbeen over I50 alum ae there. Miss Charlotte made a wonderful speach.Mov1ei w\nwere shown of the girls drilling fn their new tan and green un1forms,and must say\nthey were just as good as the WAACS and WAVES. Hhss C. brought four gilrs with\nher and they sang the1r_marching song,and made speaches,and it was really very\nattractivg and festive, and impressive. Marianna Coleman and Betty Iselin were\nthere so I saw some old Pals I knew among the sea of strange faces. We find that '\nso far we'have not a Fbxcrofter in either the WAACS or WAVES. Maybe I shall\nbe the first. I was told while I was there that the aptitude test they give you\non entering is what decides whether you are eligible for Officers training. You\nhave to get over so; to be a private and get IIO [percent]marks to be chosen as an officer.\nYou know me- I am far from smart, my education was lousy,and I could Nbt pass a\nthing. That is what frightens me. I should hate to be in as a private for the\nduration. You then cant speak to officers and I am told cant live anywhere except\nin barracks. I would N't do it if that was to be my fate. Gee really am stick a .\nas to what to do. I cant get anywhere but stay in Vasgington if I dont try for\nthe WAACS. I am_stuiped as to how to decide what to do. Charlie Cheston just called\nme this m1nute.he is in the Col's office. He works with us now. He said to sit tight\nfor a week and he would know alot more about it, and will let me know, so I may\nknow more later on- next time I write you. Mr Cheston asked about you and Morris\nand Armant,and told me he had seen Kathrine a couple of weeks ago. I dont remember\nhlmalthough I believe he was up in Maine with us was n't hefor was it Philla? that\nwe knew him?\nAll my love goesto you my darling as always, I think of you so much all\nthe time and wonder where you are and what you are doing at all moments of the\nday.\nAlways- your- Gertie- My love to Morris too.\n[End Page 2]"
