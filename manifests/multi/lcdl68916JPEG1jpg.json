      "value": "Washington\nMay 20 1945\nDear Sidney,\nI am down here working on my case\nand have been here visiting Jim and Joe for a week. To date\nnothing has happened to make me believe I shall be allowed\nto break the old Navy rule. Its stands like this. The Red\nCross is presenting a letter to the Navy stating that I have\nbeen requested by the Pacific Commissioner to go to Hawaii\nto do a specific Job. The matter will then be taken up by\nhighest Navy channels and a ruling will be made officially\non it one way or the other. I will therefor know in a day or\ntwo. The other thing suggested to me was to have you transferred\nto Washington. I said I did not believe you would like this\n- and I would rather that order were not issued. Am I right?\nI was afraid you might hate to spend a summer in Washington\neven tho' we would be together. I am afraid you would have\na dull paper Job here that would not be as interesting as\nPearl Harbor. I feel that id I am officially turned down on\ngoing out there maybe the next best thing if you wanted to\ndo it, would be to get out of the navy altogether,then we\ncould both go back to Hawaii as civilians. Please write and\nlet me know what you would like to do because while all this\nis cooking I can make a move for you in one direction or another.\nThey seem to find it far easier to order you about than to\nbreak navy rules for me, consequently I want to know what\n[End Page 1]\n2\nyou would like to do yourself. \nI am going back to New York to-morrow and will be down again\nmaybe next week to drive my station wagon north for the kids\nto use this summer. I have n't got the gas coupons or license\nplates yet but theynare under way.\nI have had a killing visit here as I have hardly seen my\nhost and hostess. They have been either out or away most of\ntheweek. I went to a party last n[i]ght given by Grace Eustice.\nA dance in her house,and I danced my arches flat,and my feet \nhurt to-day. I stayed up till nearly 4 A.M. and am dead beat\nto-day. The usual old faces were there, Baskerville, Grosver, \nGeorge Carey, Gee Marvel, and dozens of others. It was fun to\ndance again,and the champagne was very fine.\nJo and I had lunch together at Chevey Chase and the old place\nlooked the same only if anything less attractive people.\nMr Newbold had me lunch with him at the Eve Star office to\ntell some of my experiences to his buddies. I am really tired\nof describing it all or even parts, but so often one cant\nrefuse. Its too bad I am not allowed to publish it. It would  \nbe a moneymaker. Its too late for war stories now I am told,\nso when the interest again is roused five years from now\nmaybe I can do somthing about it. David Selznick said the other\nday he was using no more war stories for 5 years.\nTom Eastman took me to the theatre the other night and it was\namusing seeing him again. He is a farmer in Maryland, never\nleaves the tractor and plow,and loves it. Sonny is talking of\ntaking up farming when he gets out of uniform but I am sure\nthat is just an idea not a reality. \nMy frein[d] Marian Hall is home and I hopeto see her when I\n[End Page 2]\n3\nget up to town.\nThe weather is lovely and I wish I were playing tennis and g \ngolf or swimming instead of city life. I spent a week end  \nwith Toni but I think I wrote you about it. Hou we caught \n6 trout; broke the rod; were attacked by a swan, and then the\nowner of the rod appeared in the midst of this scene and raised\nhell at seeing her rod kaput. We landed the fish. It was a\ngood week end and I had my first game of tennis in two years.\nI am so impatient to know what I am going to\ndo and its hell waiting and wondering and getting nowhere.\nO'Conner should have written the letter to the navy but he hes\ngone your way so I think its Dick Allen that has to do it,\nand I dont know how strong he will put it. I just live in\nhopes.\nMy breakfast is brought in at 8.15 every morning\nwhether I have gone to bed at dawn or at 10P.M. consequently\nI am tired. The cloths hangers are filled with seer sucker \nsuits and the bureau drawrs have nails in them. Its something!\nI spent 4 hours at the office yesterday while\nthey figgured out how much back pay I should get. I think I\nam going to get paid a per diem for all my time in Jail. Is\nn't that a scream?\nDo write me which way you want the wind to blow in\nregard to your life so that I do not do something you dont\nwant.\nAll my love and write soon.\nGertrude Legendre\nP.S. The property owner stuff does n't work as its not\npre Pearl Harbor. Maybe we could n't get back as civilians\nagain I dont know.\n[End Page 3]"
