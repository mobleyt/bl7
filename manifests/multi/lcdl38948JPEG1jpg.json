      "value": "Please to consider this communication as private a memorandum as to the points I wish gained in my bargain. Combahee Nov 11th 1866 Messrs Wm. C. Ben & Co Dear Sirs I have been informed by Mr. Bissel that he desires to hire my Myrtle Grove Plantation. I told him that I preferred selling it. I have since thought that selling for cash was to uncertain that it would be better to rent it to Bissel if he would give such a sum as to furnish a reason to change my plan, say $2500. or even $2000. The planting of the place would necessarily increase its value. You will oblige me by intimating that you would advise the acceptance of such an offer. I am encouraged to entertain this thought by the prospect you have held out to me of obtaining the assistance of a monied partner to aid me in my planting expenses for another year and since seeing you have concluded to moderate my views as I am anxious to attain some certainty for the future as soon as possible. I am now willing to close the bargain with the capitalist [End Page 1] upon the basis of an equal division of the Net Proceeds over expenses. He must bear all the expenses and furnish the whole equipment, allow me as [illegible] for my services as manager $5. per acre for an assistant, pay and rations for a servant, the same rations and horse feed for myself and assistant. He must calculate upon a certain expenditure of $40. per acre and possibly $10. more, the money to be called for as needed. You will be able, better than I to inform him as to the best point. The equipments of the plantation and seed rice will of course demand a considerable outlay at first. I will make every endeavor to conduct matters with economy and render a faithful acc. of the expenditures. I will have the advantage of a years experience in management under the present system, a plantation better settled, railroad facilities very much increased, means of storing and putting in safety large supplies, lands in a condition to be taken up more easily &c My prospect for [recurring?] the necessary labor is very good. I expect to be able [End Page 2] to cultivate 400 or 500 acres in rice but would be glad to have the liberty of planting all my Rice Land if the labor can be procured. I have between 600 and 700 acres on this property. The crops of this plantation have now fallen as low as 40 bushels per acre since the destructive gale of 1854. They have varied from 43 to 47 bushels. The crop of the present year bids fair to reach the latter figure in well purified rice. I have as good Seed Rice on the plantation as can be purchased and by keeping it will save the freight to and from the city- Yours Very Respectfully Jas. B. Heyward P. S. It will be necessary to build a thresher and contiguous store house. I have much of the necessary materials and part of an engine, - boilers, chainery, bricks, &c on the plantation I can give a mortgage, 10 per cent interest, and pledge the entire profits of the mill to pay the debt. The capitalist who joins me in the crop may or may not contribute the money for this purpose [End Page 3] but may be willing to assist me in some way in procuring the funds from another party as I consider it altogether a separate business. The thresher would not only be useful to us but could be used to thresh for our neighbors also, the extent of whose planting may not warrant the expenditure. I suppose that $10.000 would with the assistance of the materials on hand give us a complete affair. In making the charge of $7.50 per acre for the services of myself and assistant I do not exceed the amount I will receive this year if the proceeds reach $15000., which I now consider certain. Wm. Henry Heyward by his agreement with Mr. Chadwick receives $5. per acre planted and has an overseer paid out of the crop I don't know how much. I have no overseer. If I should require one I will pay him a portion of my wages. I wish this matter to be so arranged that I may be paid one half when I finish planting and the remainder when the crop has been sold. I want Mr. Bissel also if he hires Myrtle Grove to pay me half the rent on the 1st July - the other half in Jan 1st 1868 [End Page 4]"
