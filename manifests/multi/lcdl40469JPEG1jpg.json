      "value": "xxxx Abram died on Thursday last the rainy weather caused a rapid change in him, and restlessness. He was begging to be carried to see his mother only on Wednesday. Robert told him he could not go, but if his mother could come he would have her brought. His mother is quite blind very old and feeble and when Robert told her if she wished to come he would send for her, she said she was not well enough. Robert went very early to his plantation meaning[End Page 1] to propose to old Charles to come . Just after I was dressed Lucy pushed open my window and said to me \"Abram is dead\" I asked why they had not told me he was dying. She said \"no one knew he had a dreadful night and at daylight said they must put him in his chair (I gave him a rocking chair of Elizas and sent for the best one to replace it to her.) he there fell asleep and [fresh?] died! I was thankful for this, for the last few days he suffered a good deal. he had lost the use of his hand for a week or two. I thought I would mind his death but have felt it more than I expected. I had given him up since March -- but when I looked at him dead, and remembered how much he had done for me, I was utterly overcome, and the thought of the past came over me with such power -- when he was head waiter in our house, that I grieved indeed. When I think of Abrams behavior to me for seventeen years, since I have been his mistress it seems remarkable. I spoke to him often that i was not satisfied with his conduct as a Christian -- of course he was not always pleased at times, but I really do not recollect either a disrespectful or angry answer from him and he was always so obedient. He cared for me[End Page 2] and worked to oblige me and was so intelligent that I never felt [illegible] until now. He sent and asked me some time before his death to tend to him every day as he was too weak to tend for himself. I did so, sometimes he sent me word he was too weak to listen. I was one day speaking on repentance to him and he repeated part of that hymn \"Have pity Lord, Oh! Lord forgive.\" I told him that William* said when he went to see sick persons he always asked them if they were at peace with all the world. He could not offer peace through Christ Jesus to those who were [illegible] to others. He said he felt no ill will to anybody. I hope he is safe, but oh how *Rev. Wm H Barnwell -- father of Mrs [illegible] Barnwell[End Page 3] hard to know what to think with the black people -- they are so proud and self justifying! One part of suffering has been that I cannot feel that confidence here that I desired. Even after Abram was not able to attend to the horses, he came and told me he could go on my messages - he might not have done things better than others but I thought he could, and when I found fault with Lucy or Sara* and had rude answers he said no a word or answered respectfully. I have often said that I have felt with him \"a soft answer turneth away wrath.\" Dr Henry Fuller had been prescribing for him for many weeks but I did not think he was *Maid and Laundress[End Page 4] so weak. I hope this affliction will be another lesson for me to care less about earthly things. Old Will buried him he seemed better than I have seen him for a long time. I make no apology for writing to you so fully about Abram. I know your heart goes out with me. Love to William Affectionately Yr Sister Anne Barnwell[End Page 5]"
