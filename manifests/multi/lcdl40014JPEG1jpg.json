      "value": "Columbia Dec. 17th 1840 My dear Catharine, I recd this morning the boys letter & thank them for it & am thankful to God that all have been preserved in health & safety since my leaving you. I have had something of a cold but am better. Eliza is down again & the family in general well. I have taken my seat in the Stage tomorrow night, & expect to spend Sunday in Aiken-- & to be God willing in Town on Monday. Brother Robert [illegible] promised to let Johnny come down with me, but Eliza seemed to think it best not as he was not fully provided with clothes. I wish you would request whoever preaches for me Sunday Morning to give out that Next will be the service on Christmas day & the Communion. I went to Dr Marks Academy this morning & saw Catherine Fitzsimons [?]. It is a very pleasant place. I begin to feel rather homesick though of course I could not be any where so pleasantly situated as here--for besides our own family the society is very pleasant in the campus.[End Page 1] You will excuse the shortness of the letter as they have just called me to Dinner. Kiss the children for me. God bless you all. Your affectionate husband. W.H. Barnwell [End Page 2] &lt;COLUMBIA S.C. DEC. 17&gt; Mrs. W.H. Barnwell Charleston So. Ca. [End Page 3]"
