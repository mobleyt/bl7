      "value": "Laurel Bay. Jany 18th 1832. My. dear. Day. I thank you sincerely for your very kind and interesting letter, and I thank our Heavenly Father that he has made by his Grace. my old fellow student, my new brother in Christ. Oh what shall we render to our God for all his lovefits and tender mercies! My cup was already running over, but when I read your precious letter last night, my dear Day, with my wife and son at my side, and learnt the glad tidings of great joy which it brought, my heart was filled with a sense of Gods infinite loving-kindnesses to me. and my own utter inworthiness to receive them. Oh that my resolution to devote myself. soul and body to his service may be strengthened by this fresh and delightful instance of his mercy. to me! But you will be anxious to know something of me and mine since, as you justly complain, our correspondence was broken off in 1828-- I will give you a brief outline of my history since then, which has been one series of mercies and blessings. In the fall of that year I became engaged to be married to a cousin, whose virtues, of course I am not the person to record, suffice it to say that pure religion & undefiled reigned in her heart; In 1829, upon my brother being elected to congress, I removed to our Court House Town & assumed his Practice which was extensive-- During the Summer of that year, my mind was much exercised on the subject of Religion, and the Study of the Scriptures & Prayer, & Meditation formed part of my daily business. [End Page 1] but pride and [share?] and ambition and the cares of this world, in short the carnal heart maintained its hold; and I still continued treading the broad road to destruction-- In the fall I was taken down with a fever which I have always viewed since my change of heart as a blessing; for though it did not entirely subdue the natural obduracy of my heart, it softened it very much. After my recovery I was married, how happily, you I trust will one day be able to realize by a similer blessing. My business prospered-- friends increased-- mind matured, character amended-- and to crown the whole the cry of a firstborn son gladdened my heart. Yet, thankless wretch that I was, I could not give up myself to the Lord, not withstanding all these blessings-- At times the sacrifice seemed nothing, & I was almost persuaded to become a Christian-- but pride and self would again restrain me-- At length in September last there was a four days Meeting in the village where I resided, Gillisonville. On the second day of the Meeting, having heard from the Pulpit powerful invitations to Sinners to come to Christ. by prayer for a change of heart; I was deeply impressed. At night I requested, after a great struggle, my wife to unite with me in prayer; I called upon Christ from the very bottom of an afflicted and contrite [End Page 2] formed the resolution to relinquish my present Profession and to devote myself to the service of our blessed Redeemer in his sacred Ministry. You thus see my dear Day how gracious the Lord has been to your friend as well as to yourself-- How are our blessings thus multiplied by being reflected from our friends! Oh that our dear Saviour would vouchsafe to reveal his blessed countenance to many others of our old friends at Litchfield! I regret that you should have been prevented from the pursuit of your Profession by so distressing an affection as that of the eyes usually is, and rejoice that you now enjoy the high priviledge of deriving consolation from every [illegible: hole in page. trouble?] by looking to the hand whence it comes. & by [at?] [illegible: hole in page] strongly on the promise that all things will work [illegible] for you. It is somewhat remarkable that at the time of receiving your delightful letter in which you allude to the nobleness of the Temperance cause-- we were some of the humble followers of Jesus, agitating the propriety of forming ourselves into a Temperance Society in this Neighbourhood. In fact we are to have a Public Meeting at the Court House for the purpose the day after Tomorrow-- I am so persuaded of their utility that I design establishing one upon my Plantation among my Negroes, as soon as I can. You would be much delighted to learn what the Lord has brought for us here, but my letter will not enable me to give you [a?] satisfactory account-- [End Page 3] Coosawhatchie Jany 28th 1832. I had writtn the above dear Day, the night after receiving your letter-- and the [setting?] of the Court at this place where I was compelled to be in winding up my business-- prevented my finishing the letter at that time. I send it as it is-- knowing that you will not read in the spirit of Criticism-- but of love-- Direct to me at Beaufort, for I expect to pursue my Theological Studies there-- yours with much love & many prayers. W. H. Barnwell Coosawhatchie 28 Jany To Edgar B. Day Esqr Castkill New York[End Page 4]"
