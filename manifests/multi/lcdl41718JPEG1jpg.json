      "value": "J M J. Ursuline Convent. Columbia, S.C. Dec 18th/1860. My dearest Brother, I wrote day before yesterday-- or rather had Sr Josephine to write to Dr L. Northrop as well as all who owe us for this session, ending Feb 1st, requesting payment at their earliest convenience. I was prompted to do this, because we are obliged to pay-- $135. in a few days, besides our cursory expenses of provisions, & have in hand only about-- $75. When Dr Northrop places the payment-- partial or whole, will you please pay H. F. Baker & Co $100. in acct, & send me the rest-- I trust we may get favorable replies to our letters, otherwise we shall be at a stand still for a short time-- -- & would dislike so much to have to ask any one to wait for payment, it as we profess to pay Cash on all bills presented--. You must [written on side of page:] I have scarcily left myself room to say that our sisters all unite in grateful respects & beg your blessing--. I have not heard any thing either of Julia or any at our dear home. Please pray for Your truly affectionate Sister Ellen Sr Baptiste [End Page 1] not sent me any of your money-- I really would not like it if you did-- Perhaps tomorrow's mail may bring us more than we actually need-- and already we are too much in your debt--. I only tell you this about Dr Northrop that you may not let the money lie there until you could bring it thinking it was all the same to us-- We are very much obliged to you for noticing the reception in the Miscellany-- & for the reinsertion of our Prospectus-- Did you not like the corrections I made in it--? I made them for the Convenience of Parents who so often write asking dispensations & questions on them--. Our examinations-- Manual & Banner are in progress-- & we are all, [T.G.?] quite well. I have advertised the Parents, with John's advice that the small-pox has become an epidemic, tho of a mild form-- I suppose however all have left who will, unless Mr Ferrall takes his daughter home. I have enjoyed your letters to Abp Hughes, & the Complimentary preface--. I have just written to Bb Wood of Phila to tell him of his postulants. John has small-pox among his negroes & is \"down in the Cellar\" about money-- but \"there is a silver lining to every cloud.\" [End Page 2]"
