I say et the people of  Charleston \" decide whether they  want their streets north, south,  least or west.. The right to vote oh  this question is theirs. .et the people vote. It\"s their \" town, they  bought it; THEY ARE Charleston. By Goy, et them show it. .  As you may have guessed by  now, I\"m from- Texas. Not that it-  has any difference, for I think any  American would see the situation  eye - to-eye\" -with me. But, may I  put forth thisi one suggestion?    Since, yoii-a â€žaren\"t Texares, you  could act ike them. For we aways  stick together on one-side or the  other. You- Charlestonians, get to-   gether- and vote, on, this most imT  portaht question; don\"t et- a, bunch  of money-minded business men - j  choke your toWn to death.  MRS. J, E. BROWN.  Nava\"Base. ,-   -,. -  To The  News .and Coiwigr:  According to the recent newspaper artice the .merchants would  ike sooje opinion from the Public  on the present traffic plan.  A great many people have given  up in disgust expressing\" opinions  when they know that\" any plans,  traffic or otherwise, are in such  great .measure- controed, by a  small group of sefistw merchants  [not a]  and not the Public.  Under the Smith \"-Dibbe.plan  there were more parking places  and\"-a smoother flow of traffic. If  we could only use this plan\"without too much inconvenience to any  one.  The present \"zig-zag, \" one-way  today and two-way tomorrow\" affair is terribe. Meeting street\", is  particuary . -bad with, two-way  traffic and no parking.  Jacksonville and Miami have a  one-way traffic system simiar to  the Smith-Dibbe plan and it.works  very we with their great amount  of traffic and\" especiay . for a  stranger , drliving. , around\"\", their  streets. I am sure\"the tourist coming through Charestop now and in  the future wi, -find\" the \"traffic  quite  a harassing- probem.  -  .  Cj ANDERSON.  Charleston.  Mixed-Up Traffic plan  To .The News and Courier:  \"This traffic stranguation has  plenty of Charlestonians hot under  their coars. I\"m not a Charleston-  ian, but et me te you, my coar  is hot, too; and, I might add, here\"s  the reason why.  To begin: Before the Smith-Dibbe traffic plan\" was ever put into  operation, the merchants of this  town cried \"Down with The plan\".  And within a week after, the plan  was adopted, a petition was start-\"  ed to change it-which finay sue-.  ceeded.  Now, in Wednesday\"s paper we  read, \"Asked yesterday if the aternative traffic plan,   which has  been effective since February 5.  had- prduced any noticeable effect  on King street business, Sidney C.  Snegrove, Jr., president of the  merchants associaltion, said it was  TOO EARY to determine effects,  -if any.\"  It would seem that the merchants aren\"t capable of taking defeat. Surey.they should realize by  now that if a woman decides to  go shopping,, she\" come to town  regardless of whether the streets  are upside, dowia. sideways, par-,  ae or perpendicuar-..  I am of unbiased opinion on this  street condition, but- what really  makes me mad is, this three-man  committee. This Isn\"t Russia; This  is America. Things-of importance  or otherwise, are NOT decided by  \"-CH  ARESTOH  aou-ssiiw  FEB 17 \"51"
