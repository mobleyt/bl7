      "value": "September 27, 1945\nHello Nimrod,\nWhatcha doing killing feathery creatures again when\nthere has been so much slaughter in the world. Also arent you a\nlittle bit afraid that this might be and probably will be a second\nFort Kaperle.\nCertainly is fun talking to you on the phone even though\nI c nt hear everything you say. It seems so natural and as you say\n\"just as if you were in the same room\". than I return I am going to\ngive you a big hug and a kiss and tell that phone to watch me do it\ninstead of my having to say \"I send you all my love\" over it.\nGetting out of the Navy is quite a hysterical proceeding\nout here. I started on the 20th. and am still in it but going strong.\nTo give youthe idea of the efficiency of it all I will tell you\none thing that happened. I first had to go to Aiea where they\nkeep my health record. There I was given a physical exam, a very\nthorough one wich covered everything. My chest with all the air out\nwas 89, filled up with air was 41, my waist was 39, my temperature\n98, pulse 76, blood pressure 110 and weight 82. The next day\nI reported to the sope ration center and was told that I had to take\nanother physical exam. I explained I had just finished one that took\nan hour but that did not make any difference. On this exam my chest\nmeasurements were 35 and 36, my wai st was 59, pulse 90, blood pressure\n125 and weight 90. Oh I forgot I also had grown an inch overnight.\nAfter ll thishad been finished we were told that we h d not\nbrought our pay accounts and of course it was too later for them\nto take care of them that day, come back the next afternoon at 2pm.\nThe next day at two we were told there had been a slight mix up with\nour exrays to come back today, today we were told that it was to bad\nbut the officer who was to sign our pa ers had left, had received\nan urgent call , would we return in the morning. However having been\nin the Navy for some time I asked \"will he be here on Saturday, or\nwould it be better if we returned Monday. I think that would be safer\nthe yeoman said. So back e go on Monday. However I think things\nare go ng to improve out here as I was to d that Admiral Nimitz has\nfired Capt. Lewis the District personnel officer and Captain Kane\nat the head of the receiving station for the lousy work they hadve\ndone in connection with getting men out of the service.\nThis Sunday we are giving a party to the men who we hav\nbeen playing tennis with at the Beretania Tennis Club. They are\ncoming with their wives and there will be about thirty people in all.\nWe are going to have a round robbin tennis tournament first, give\nprizes and then a buffet dinner. It should be very good fun I think.\nWe bought two turkeys that a little jap caterer is g ing to cook \nand we are going to have sald and ice cre m  nd coffee ith it.\nThese men h ve been the nicest to us since we have come out here. I\nh ve never seen their wives but will let you know all about them. \n[End Page 1]\nLast Monday night we were asked up to the Wilders\nfor dinner. They live on the top of Tantalus mountain in an old\nbrown stained wood house. We had a delicious buffet dinner of\nroast beef, creamed potatoes, saldd, ice cream and cake. They\nhad the liveiliest plates I have ever seen. Persian pottery,\nthat wonderful blue that you get out there. Pictures of birds on\nthe plates, and persi an writing on the back. I would love to\nhave had them.\nJimmy Wilder said that he knew you and Sarah Jane,\nbut I was unable to discuss you very much with him as he passed\nout about nine oclock. I did not have a drink and wondered how in\nthe world to leave when I got sleepy, but was really stuck because\nAdmiral Halsey was there and we could not go before he left. He\nagain started the conversation about the apartments and the two\ngirls but I walked away. Once is enough. At eleven he arose to\nleave and we filed out behind him. There  ere only about twelve\nof us altogether, one  dmiral, Carney,was very nice but I was\nso sleepy from tennis that I could not carry on any conversation\nat all. Mrs [Betty Wilder] was attractive and had a very good\nsense of humor. Anyway you c n see I am meeting all the people for\nyou.\nTat Saunders clothes have not arrived yet. I wish the\nwould as I would like to see what they look like. I have no\nidea what sort of t ings she has sent and therfor cannot say whether\nthey are the type that will sell out here or not. Jo Jo has not\nanswered any of my letters, and as a resultthere is a slight mix\nup in finances but I will straighten that out on my ret rn. Her\natomic bonb letter never arrived, so I think she either cooled\noff or sent it to the wrong address.\nI  m terribly sorry that you Aculpulco trip f ll\nthrough, but then neither I nor anyone else expected Ellen to go,\nyou least of all. If there is one thing that you can be sure of\nthat is that Ellen Fraser will not go on a trip and especially to\na place more she has not been before. She will go to Watch Hill,\nPalm Beach and Long Isl nd, but that isthe limit. I think you\nwould have had a wonderful time there swimming and playing in the\nsun and I am sorry th t you did not go.\n s far as this shooting trip goes I do not want\nto go on it. If I come home before the ninth then I think that\nwe c n do things together that would be more amusing. If I\nget home after the ninth then I would suggest that you go on the\nshooting trip until my arrival and then we can join up and do all\nand everything we please.\nSo long sweeheart, it wont belong now beofre we\nwill be together. All my love\n[End Page 2]"
