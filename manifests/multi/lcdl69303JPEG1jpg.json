      "value": "II\nOctober 1, 1942\nGertle Darling, \nThank you so much for the ear drums. They are wonderful\nand just what I wanted. I wore them yesterday with rubber fins on\nmy feet and thought the government would seize and put me in their\nstock pile of rubber. Have you ever tried those swimming fins. They\nare marvellous andone goes as fast as a motor boat with them on.\nSwimming the regular way it takes me about an hour to go out to\na buoy that is not more than fifty yards from the shore but with\nthem on I get there before I can take my breath.\nI have just finished the most wonderful \"round about\" that\nyou have ever known. I was sent out by my captain to obtain something\nand started asking at the bottom and then gradually went to the\ncaptain at the top. He in turn referrred me to the man below him so\nthat at thex end of four hours I had made the complete circle of\ntwelve men and was right back at where I had started without\nobtaining the thlng I set out for. Hwever it did not bother me\nat all. I figured I had done my best and if no one wanted to\nmake a decision or try to help there was nothing that I could do.\nHowever one man did give me excellent advice. He said \"go back\nand get someone with eagles on their collars [to make the request] and you will get some\nwhere.\" I think he had the secret.\nMorris and I worked until ten thirty last night arranging\nfiles and winding up a mass of correspondence. My feet really\nhurt by the time I got home. It is so slow driving at night wit_h\nthe faint black out lamps[,] as you can not see your hand in front\nof your face and have to creep along. It is impossible to\ndistinguish anyone walking along the street until you are on t[op of them]\n[End Page 1]\nYou asked me in one of your letters what chance there\nwas of your comming out here. I have enquired everywhere and the\nonly way that I can find out is for you to pass a civil service \nexam and apply for a civil service job. Then you ask for duty ln\nin the Hawaiin islands and by the time you are given it I will be\nin some other post. I really think I will be sent home or to another\npost before you arrive here. Also there is nothing as iteresting\nin the way of a job as you have or xxxxxxx any job that has the\nfuture possibilities of travel that you have now. You know how\nwe have always said that lt is impossible to tell what the future\nholds and that when you try to make plans they never come out.\nI think this may be the case now. With the uncertainity of everything\nI believe that our chances of comming together in the near future\nwill be better if we do not try to make arran gments and tie ourselves\nup with naval contracts to work and civil service arrangements.\nMorris played tennis yesterday but I was to tired and just\nwnet for a short swim andthenstretched out on my bed. In a little\nwhile the old man came in so pouped that he could hardly talk, and \ncroaked that I should force brandy down histhroat. However I let\nhim lie there and waited to collect hisinsruance . He pulled through\nsomehowand is rushing around again today doing big things and giving\nall the yeoman hell because the desks are not dusted or because there\nare mistakes in the letters. If he does not end up a captain I will\nbe very much suprised because he is the most efficent person I have\never seen. when this war isover I am going to put you and Morris\nworking for me[,] and while I lie in a hammock you too can win a great\nfortune on which I will live in luxury. By now I am sure you\ntalk in crisp short sentences, and utter commands in a stacacco\nvoice. What I wish you would tell me at your earliest\n[End Page 2]\nconvenience dear madam is, do people jump to their feet when \nyou address them, and are your orders law[?] I would give anything to\nwalk into your office nqw and see you . It would be such fun to\nlaugh about our business abilities again and than to go out and eat\nmuch to much lunch und loaf through the afternoon. I love Sundays\nso, because I can lie on the beach and let the sun pour down on my\nback with never the thought of the morrow. Do you remember\nhow in Seal Harbor we use to lie on the wooden platform of the\nclub and sun bathe in a semi stupor. You loved it like a cat and\nI couldhardly get you to come and eat those wonderful lunches that\nthe negroes use to cookd for us. Then we would walk to Jordans\npond and stuff ourselves on popoevers and give Clippy little\npieces to make him fat and I use to call him a fat pig. How happy\nwe were. Andfortunately it doesn not seam at all long ago. I\nseem recently to be able to push time back so that everything that  \nwe did together was only ye_sterday. As a resutxt it makes the\ntime we have been seperated seem like nothing compared to what it\nmight be if I counted the days, weeks and months. I remember so\nclearly all the conversations we had togehter and the things we\nwe have done during our thirteen years of married life, and I thank\nGod for these happy memories because they are such a comfort to me\nnow.\nI have just been appointed treasurer forthe coffee and\nCoca cola mess and expect to lose my shirt. Why the officers have\nto have coffee brewing all the time isquite beyond me. I think it\nonly-takes them away from their work, as they are always getting\nup for a cup of coffee or a coca cola and must take at least ten\n[End Page 3]\nminutes for each drink. Nevertheless it appearsto be an old\nnavy custom and one that they will not break.\nWe had dinner at the wagon wheel[,] a little resturant\nnear our hotel last night. We both ordered fruit salad as our main\ncourse and it was wonderu l. Big slices of pinapple, paupaya,\nand other native fruits. It was served ice cold and could not have\nbeen a more delicious hot weather dish. Get Rose to make it\nfor you some time. It is a dry sald , no juices or sugar, and you\nmust have it in a heaping bowl. Yesterday for lu[n]ch at the bachelor\nofficers quarters we had Ricestaffel. Wonderful. Heaping mounds of\nrice with all sorts of goodies on top. A man was ther[e] who had been\nin [S]ingapore xxxx during the attack and he was most interesting.\nIt is fascinating when you talk to the ones that have been in the\nbattles and deadly dull when you read long treatises on ballistics[,]\nor something equally dull.\nI off again to see a man about obtaining transportation\nforthe office and guess I till see fifty before I am through.\nI send you all my love dear and a great big hug and kiss.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 4]"
