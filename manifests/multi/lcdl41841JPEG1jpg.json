      "value": "A.M.D.G. Ursuline Convent Columbia, S.C. July 31st 1863 My dearest Brother, Both John & I have been wondering at your silence -- he feels a little hurt at your not noticing his letters, & so neglecting him I believe. Today he tells me of anther hogshead of sugar being at the depot for us, & we are so much obliged to you for it. Mr Dempsey of Macon Georgia who has just left, offers to purchase sugar for us there too, at a cheaper rate than it sells here, & John advises ne to get some as a safe investment. We also want coffee & rice -- but if you don't send the bills along with the Merchandise, I'll not be satisfied. Please write soon, & tell us how you are & if you will visit us before or after our retreat. You know we enter into it on the feast of the \"Transfiguration\" & remain until the \"Assumption.\" Father Gache will I expect leave Lynchburg on tomorrow, as his furlough extends from[End Page 1] Aug 1st to the 20th. I asked you in my last letter about our going out to see Barhamville with John, but I am afraid retreat time will come before I get your reply. We have almost concluded to buy it, & are anxious to do so -- the interest of our academy & the health of our Sisters both seem to require a country place & fresh air. Pupils are already coming in, & soon we shall have thousands of confederate money on hand, besides what we already have in Bank & invested in Cotton. We purpose also selling our cotton rather than pay the present taxes, storage, & insurance on it, & turning that, in to Barhamville property also. Please let me hear from you at your earliest convenience. What about this will & letter of yours -- sent from[End Page 2] Camden. Shall I send it to you -- I would have done so before, but was expecting you up. I believe I'll enclose you the letters & keep the will, as it is a larger package & Charleston is so unsafe too. But I will send it immediately if you wish. Genl Beauregard's sister called her a few days since -- Mrs Proctor, I think is her name, we had quite a pleasant conversation & she spoke of placing her little daughter with us. We have just recd a young lady of some pretensions from New Orleans Mademoiselle Le Sveum? -- a good Catholic. Please excuse the great haste in which I write. John returns from Cheraw on Wednesday. Mother was well & busy -- Father looking very well indeed. Francis well excepting his shoulder -- singular coincidence was it not, he & John getting such a severe fall by their horses on the same day?[End Page 3] Sister Gertrude, I am sorry to say, is growing every day more like poor Bernard & is growing more inert -- every thing fatigues her. Sr Rose too looks very much like a consumptive. Sr Marie St Angel in confined to her bed the greater part of her time, & today we have three sick Lay Sisters the last however I do not mind, it is only the warm weather & some disarrangement of systems. You must not go the trouble of looking after coffee & rice for us now, because I mentioned them, for I intend asking Mr Huchet to get us the rice as he did before, & will write to Mr Dempsey of Macon, accept his kind offer, & get it cheaper than here, where it sells at $4. pr lb. I will say nothing of the sign of the times, for I have not space. All join in grateful respects to you begging your prayers & benediction especially Sr Gertrude & your own Sister Ellen Sr Baptiste Sup.[End Page 4]"
