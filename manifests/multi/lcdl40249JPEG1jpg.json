      "value": "Columbia South Carolina Feb, 8th 1849. My Dear Little Sister, Today is your, birth day. & I must send you this letter as a [illegible] present, I must first acknowledge the receipt of your letter and must beg you to return my sincere thanks for Mamma for a very acceptable box-- Every thing was so very nice & I can assure her that justice was given to it both in word & deed. The maccaroons were universal favorites--. I saved 6 of them & sent them together with the quince jelly to Maj Harts-- a family I will tell you of presently--. I was glad to hear that you were studying hard, & endeavoring to improve, but as advice is not much of a present, I will touch upon other subjects. And first of all Maj Harts family-- He is a very fine old gentleman, but it is of the younger part of the family I will write, Miss [Eliza?] [illegible], Miss Starke Hart & Miss Jane Hart., The first one of the finest old maids I have ever met, The second is about 22, but one of the best hearted & Kindest person I ever met--. she is quite pretty too-- very intelligent & a universally esteemed, Miss Jane is engaged to John Thomson.[End Page 1] she is about 19-- extremely pretty & intelligent. Her face is one we seldom meet, & her character not to be equalled by one in an hundred. I have Know them ever since I have been to Columbia, but never became intimate with them until my visit to Orangeburg where I staid with them at Col Glovers & They are universally loved & esteemed in Columbia, They are in bad circumstances, & Miss Starke Keeps school for little children Both of them [illegible] members of the church, & their society is much more beneficial than that of most Columbia young ladies. I have been there very often, & drop in [illegible: to?] see them whenever I can-- They make one feel quite at home, & I have much reason to congratulate myself upon their acquaintance. The family is in some way connected with Dr. Michels-- and Miss Eliza Heron says “she recollects Ted & Myself playing at Dr M,’s when 2 curly headed little fellows.” I am going on Saturday to ride on horseback with Miss J. to pay a visit to Col Singleton, I suppose Mamma told you of my determination not to go to the dancing parties,-- Well I have Kept it so far. I have been to 2 or 3 [illegible: sitting?] parties however, I went to Mrs Green’s once, where I met the most staid & sober, of the grave-- to Mrs Izards once, to a party of 9-- 4 ladies & 5 gentlemen-- [illegible] an evening tea fight--. To Col Singleton once, this was quite a large party-- given in honor of Mrs Floyd, wife of the Governor of Virginia, I went in Company with Miss Jane[End Page 2] Hart and of course Kept within the bounds of my baptismal vows--. There was a Party given too at Mr John Prestons-- where all the aristocratic old folks figured extensively a vast number of antiquated dames, & hoary spouses, three or four professors. & 3 professors wives, & 6 or 7 young ladies with a goodly share of young gentlemen. I again went with Miss Jane Hart in Mr. Pelhams carriage, I never have seen & never again expect to see the like display of furniture & silver only think of it. $18,000 worth of silver was exposed!!. There was not a piece of [horn?] or ivory to about 12 dozen Knives & forks-- all silver!! There was not a tumbler--. all silver cups washed inside with gold!! [&?] every thing else in proportion. The supper cost 500$--. I could not help thinking however-- “How true is it, that money makes one foolish, & miserable”-- foolish because it can be nothing else, to be so extravagant, & miserable for there was Mr P. & his lady in much anxiety. & a great deal more agitation, lest, Something may be out of order.-- a Knife dull a dish crooked or the slightest thing any of the common ware of the majority of society--. All this though does not interfere with my studies for, I prepared my recitations before hand. I have had many more invitations, but refused them. & now I am glad that you are going to see Miss Ella--. Give her my Kind & sincere remembrances--. Tell her I miss her merry face & company at the parties, & hope you have many a pleasant chat next Spring[End Page 3] Tell her that Mr Barnwell & a few others often [recur?] to the many pleasant scenes of Orangeburg--. the pleasant people & pleasant ladies & the pleasantest of all-- Miss Ella !! Be sure & tell her just as I have written it, She sent me a message & I got it, & so be sure to tell her just word for word as I have written-- & By the By-- Have you been to see the Balls. Mamma may think me presumptive to write this, but I think it foolish for me to be squeamish about these little things. I wish then you would go to see them often & if you would be too bashful, try in some way, to make Amelia & Miss Ella acquainted, on her account, or Miss Ella’s & mine, on hers for I am sure she will meet a worthy & pleasant acquaintance on Miss E’s because I want Miss E to Know her-- & on [mine?] because they are both favorites of mine & I would like them to be acquainted. Tell Amelia for me-- that I am too sorry that I could not hear her sing-- but hope to see & hear her next Summer, notwithstanding, her hopes to Go to the North-- (Mind & do it). Well if any thing but advice is a good birth day present- I think I have sent you a fine one. (I have written to Aunt M-- give her my love. & many thanks for her presents, especially the remembrance-- which is always the great part of a present--. Give Mamma. a thousand thanks & 10 thousand Kisses-- for her Kind attentions & Give Cathy promise of a long letter soon. Hetty I must now commence a Correspondence with, Ted I will write to soon, though his last letter was very impudent-- Willie & Ste, I hope are good boys-- Nan a little lady-- Joe a bouncing handsome boy--. & Al-- -- an improved chap--. &. My Sister Bet, an obedient, well behaved, Miss--. all of which is sincerely hoped by Your affec brother Robert PS. (I hope Papas health is good & the convention not troubling him too much--. I suppose his time is so much taken up that I will not expect a letter immediately-- Give him much love from me-- I hope I will be a son worthy of his [love?]--[End Page 4]"
