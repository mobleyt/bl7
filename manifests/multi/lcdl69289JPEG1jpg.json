      "value": "25 May 1943\nDear Gertrude:\nI have the most wonderful sun-burn. The day dawned, a perfect blue\nsky, and a brilliant sun topped the mountains, and flooded the Ala Wai\nwith golden light. It was so lovely in our apartment, with the flowers\nthat you sent me, and the breeze sweeping through the venetian blinds.\nI had hardly finished breakfast, before I went down to the beach, put on\nmy suit, and took out the surf-board. The waves were breaking high, with\nenormous foaming crests a quarter of a mile out; so that it looked as if\nwe were going to have a magnificent time, on account of the lenght of run\npossible. The entire Hawaiian Navy was there. You know, they call the\noutrigger canoes and surf-boards, the Hawaiian Navy - which I think is a\nlovely name. The boards were so close together that they were absolutely\ninterlaced, and reminded as of the taxi-cab jams on Forty-second Street\nand Broadway. Every time a wave came, we would all start to paddle, after\nfirst giving a loud yell. As the wave swept down on us, and lifted us up,\nthere was wild confusion. Some people would slide off to the left, and\nwith of course, the others sliding to the right. Then they would bump,\nthe boards would fly up in the air, and all you would see was legs and arms,\ndisappearing into the white foam. After the excitement had quieted down,\nand the waves had gone on towards the shore, boards and heads hobbed up\neverywhere, and the sea was pin-pointed with black dots. There really\nwere too many people out to be much fun, as it was dangerous. The inex-\nperienced bumping into the experienced, and the experienced ones, thinking\nthat every one else knew how to surf-board, and therefore going their own\npleasant way; without taking into consideration the fact that others could\nnot maneuver their boards. Whether we left any dead bodies lying under the\nwater on the coral, I do not know, but I returned to shore at two c'clock,\nbruised and broken.\nMorris and I had a delicious luncheon of chicken salad here, on the\nsun terrace, over-looking the sea, as we watohed the remaining heroes\nstill trying to come in on the waves. The meal made me very sleepy\nand I was about to lie down to take a nap, when another man suggested that\nwe go up to see a wonderful house that he knew of. This was the most perfect\nhouse that I have ever seen. The road climbed a hill, turned to the left,\nand disgorged into a wide courtyard, surrounded by high walls, covered w ith\nBougainvilla vines. Directly in front, was a garage, which was not really\na garage, but a cave in a wall of rock, that dropped down the mountain-\nside. To the right was a narrow stair, tiled with blue tile. It curved\nas it mounted, until you arrived at the first story of the house, and\nentered through a large glass door. To your amazement you had not entered\nthe house at all, but were now in a patio, completely surrounded on three\nsides by the building; and on the fourth side, by Diamond Head, which\ndropped down, forming a straight wall against the back of the house.\nAll of the bedrooms opened on to this patio, which was aflame with\nBougainvilla, Ginger, and Star Jasmine vines.\n[End Page 1]\n2.\nThe rooms all had cork floors, were not very large, but each had attached\nto it, an enormous bathroom and dressing room, in which the drawers to\nhold the clothes, were made of glass, and were mounted on roller bearings,\nso that they slid in and out, noislessly; at the same time, you could see\nwhat was in each drawer, without bothering to open it. Some of the walls\nwere mosaiced with storks, cherry tree blossoms, etc., and as they were\npainted white, it fitted in beautifully. Looking something like\nCharley Baskerville's screen. Very airy and light and decorative. While\none side of the bedrooms opened into the patio, the other side opened on\nto porches that over-looked the sea. There was an enormous central\nliving room with a fire-place, and the rest, wide open to the world. Great\nwindows that slid back and forth, and let the sun pour in, so that the\nChinese yellow carpet on the floor was ablaze with light. As you stepped\nout of this room on to the front porch, you saw the most magnificent\npicture before you. Away down below, lay the blue sea, stretching out to\nthe horizon, all aglitter with sunlight. To the right, the curve of\nWaikiki Beach disappeared into the palm trees surrounding the Halekulani\nHotel. While to the left, the scimitar of white sand curved slowly until\nit met Koko Head. A cascade of Bougainvilla vines fell from the roof\nto the porch, and continued in waves down the rock wall until it met the\nroad, far below. Big leaves, plants, and bushes, rose up from the ground\non the right, and hung over the sides of this porch, forming little\nshady spots in which were grouped gay colored chairs, and tiny little\nglass-topped tables. A ladder took you up to the top of the house,\nwhich was flat roofed, and here everyone was able to take sun baths.\nIt is really the most perfect spot I have ever seen. Perhaps some day\nwe shall be able to live in a place, similar to it.\nY our letter of the 16th. just arrived and I read it with tremendous\npleasure. What interesting dinners you have, and fascinatingpeople at them.\nReally you have met the tops, and I assure you that if you join the Waacs\nand are a second lieut. you will find that life closed, because for some\nreason as soon as you go into an military organization rank seems to be\nof great importance, and Field Marshalls just cannot dine with officers of\nlow rank, although they are delighted to stay with you when a civilian\nstatus is matained. Your picture of the Virginia countryside was so\nalluring, the green fields, horses and crops. There is something about\nthe country that charms me, but pa[s]t experience has taught me the bitter\nlesson that acres are aches. The only crops they grow are bushels of\ntroubles so that ones entire time is taken up with petty details and the\ninteresting things in life sweep by leaving you in the backwash of fertilizer\ncombines and sick mules. I would rent the combine to Gippy for $15.00 a\nday. Rental to start the moment they take it and to continue until it arrives\nback under our shed. This will keep them from leaving it in their fields for\nweeks after they have finished using it. They are to do all the transporting\nand must return the machine in exactly the same condition it was when they took\nit away. In other words they are responsible for all breaks. If they do not want\nit on these conditions, leave it where it is. I am tired of being a sucker.\nGoodbye darling, I send you all my love and hope that the days are continuhly\ngrowing shorter to that time when I may take you in my arms again.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
