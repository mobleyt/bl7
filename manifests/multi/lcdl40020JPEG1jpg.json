      "value": "Rock Hill Oct 8. 1841. I have desired for some time to address you a few lines, my respected friend and Pastor, but have found that the unsettled Kind of life which one leads where they have no fixed occupation is the very field upon which Procrastination seems to batten. You no doubt would long since have been [gratified?] to know how successful have been our efforts with our Sunday School. Those efforts have been blessed far beyond what we expected and infinitely beyond what they deserved. For alas! I find at the bottom of the heart, motives of action which to the [illegible] of all hearts must render everything of this kind now only not acceptable, but even as abomination. Of this I will speak [illegible: after?] I have informed you of results upon others. We have had a pretty constant attendance of the Children, and they and their parents have been inspired with an Interest in the School. During the whole Season, we have been interrupted by the weather but one Sabbath, and even on that day there was a considerable number who happened to have started before it rained. We always have upwards of Forty and generally between Fifty and Sixty Children. These of all ages, some able to read and others not. We have been able to interest a sufficient number of Teachers-- among whom you will be pleased to hear of Mrs Claiborne-- Mrs Andrew Johnston who have been permanent female Teachers with Mrs Memminger, and occasional aid has been recd from[End Page 1] visitors. Fortunately we have had Male Teachers enough for the Boys-- myself and a Teacher of a School here, together with a Tutor in Mr Johnston's family being permanent. There being fewer boys, than girls, we have been able to bring them on well, all the children seem to have improved much, and the country people themselves have begun to take up the matter, so as to endeavour to have other Schools in other localities. I hope no sectarian jealousy is mingled with these efforts; I have endeavoured earnestly to avoid rousing it. Our Pastor here is unfortunately what is called \"an absent man\"-- or I should hope the thing was established. Mr Trapier can inform you more particularly about him. If we had but Mr Pinckney, we should consider the church as the fostering Mother of these children, and would feel sure that they would be as well cared for as they could me. But they as well as ourselves are in the hands of One who will provide for all better than each can for himself. The only embarrassment we have had, has arisen from want of Books. Not imagining anything like the number which have come, we were insufficiently provided with Books, and the disappointment in receiving an order which I left at the Methodist Book Store for Mr Capers Catechism, with another title page occasioned us much regret. Bishop Ives informed me that he had prepared a Book for the unlearned which he thinks would better suit us, than Mr Capers' Book, and that he is about to publish it this winter. He explained the plan more in detail, and I concur with him in the opinion of its suitableness. The idea is to go upward from sensible objects. The error in all the Books which I have seen is that they commence with abstractions.[End Page 2] But while thus striving, I am in deep anxiety as to the condition of my own heart. Alas! upon sifting its motives and feelings, they cannot bear the scrutiny of a sinful creature like myself! What must be their appearance to the eye of a Holy God. The promotion of His Honor is not the motive of my Conduct-- even the good of my fellow creatures is not the sole object on view-- but I find mixed up with it, a feeling of vanity-- a Kind of pride that that entity Known as myself should succeed in this as in other things-- a desire to be able to build up where others have failed. It grieves me most deeply-- I have struggled against it-- I have prayed against it. But alas! it has pleased my Father to give us answer to my prayers-- for I am but too conscious that they are not in the spirit which finds acceptance. I have lived so long without God in the world, that the world [illegible: hole in page. became?] my [Tool?], and ambition and the Love of Praise and admiration have become a part of my nature-- and unless it please my Maker to create me anew, I am but a lost creature. I am but too sensible that I am yet in the gall of bitterness and in the Bond of Iniquity. When I made my Christian Professions I was blind as to the condition of my heart. I thought I had deeply repented me of my past life and that through the mercy and merits of a Saviour I had found acceptance. But now I see that there was with it all, an idea that I was bringing something to God which might aid his cause-- that there was a something in myself, which might be worthy of acceptance. Alas! I Saw not that I was nut a poor and blind and naked creature-- and all my righteousness was but filthy rags. But now that I see it, I am almost in despair. I find myself so utterly worthless, and yet from day to day I continue in sin without any visible amendment. Even my prayers are without fervor-- and I look upon the season passing [End Page 3] I have in the forgoing lines expressed Some of the feelings which oppress my heart. I would ask your counsel, did I not fear that aid is not to be had from man. Your Sympathy I Know I will have. I remain here three weeks longer and then return to Charleston to be plunged again into a vortex which Knows no rest Your sincere friend CG Memminger [written on side of page:] C G Memminger Oct 8th. 1841. Flat Rock NC Oct 10 Paid 18 3/4 Revd Wm H. Barnwell Charleston South Carolina. and cannot but fear that the harvest is well nigh past, and I am not saved. God be merciful to me a Sinner indeed-- for I am in the deepest anxiety-- in the very depths of despair, and Satan has the mastery over me. Oh that I had but a dawning of Spiritual Mindedness and could shake from my soul the world and all its temptations. Come Lord Jesus-- come quickly. Oh take not thy Holy Spirit from me. [End Page 4]"
