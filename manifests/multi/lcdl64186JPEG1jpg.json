      "value": "[Charles Petit to Nathanael Greene\nNovember 2, 1781\n[RvW Box 2 Folder 58; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\nPhiladelphia 2d. Novem.r 1781\nDear Sir,\nIt was not till some days after Major Pierce's arrival in\nthis town that I received your fav.r of the 17th. of Sept.r owing,\nas he afterwards told me, to its being packed up with his eastern\nletters; and as I had not had the pleasure to be acquainted with\nhim before, I began to apprehend I should lose the opportunity\nof getting that information about you which a tete a tete only\ncan give.  After receiving your letter, however, I sought and\nobtained an acquaintance with the Major, and it has been a\npleasing one -  I can only regret that circumstances have not\npermitted him to spend so much time with my family as I \nwished, as well on account of his own merit, as from the regard\nyou express for him.\nI congratulate you most sincerely on your series of\nsuccesses amidst the series of complicated difficulties you have\nhad to encounter, and particularly in the arduous affair at Eutaw.\nI leave it to your less firmly attacked friends, and to the world\nat large to sound your praises and speak of your merit and\nthat of the band of Heroes it has been your good fortune to\ncommand: they do it I assure you not unsparingly, and I feel\nmyself so much interested in it, that on many occasions I seem\nto feel myself as your representative in receiving the incence [sic]\nand in such cases the calls of modesty oblige me to say no more\nthan that to shew [sic] that I receive it with grateful complacence. Were there\nany doubtful points, or any clouds or shades arising which\nwould obscure the brilliancy of your conduct, it would become\nyour friends to remove them; but nothing of the sort appears,\nand I may say with a truth that fills me with satisfaction\nthat no campaign or series of actions during the war has obtained \nmore universal approbation [and] applause than those in the Carolinas\nduring the last twelve months – May your Laurels never \nfade!\nMajor Pearce is kind enough to take charge of 7 shirts\nand as many stocks for you. Major Burnet undertook to\nsend you a hat with some other articles he had in charge\nto forward to you. What he has done respecting them I am\nnot informed, not having heard from him since Major Pierce's \narrival\n[End Page 1]\narrival. I fear his health has failed him, or that some other\ncause not known when he went from here, detains him. I have\nneither seen nor heard from him since Major Pierce's arrival.\nHe left in my hands some bills of Exch.g – at first he desired me\nto sell a few to raise a little ready money for Capt. Swan [and] some other\npurposes; afterwards he desired me to sell more. I went on till\nI had sold upwards of 20,000 dollars. Majr. Burnet, for certain reasons,\nthought it best not to communicate to the Treasury that he had these\nbills; but the sale brought it to the knowledge of the Financier\nwho has spoke to me on the subject [and] desired me to sell no more.\nI did not inform him of the quantity, but left him to suppose it\nwas about 20,000 Dollars. - The money is yet chiefly unappropriated.\nThey sold from 5/. to 5/3 the dollar. If the money is to be turned over\nto the Treasury, which may be the case if they undertake to furnish\nthe supplies Major Burnet is in pursuit of, I shall try hard to get\npayment out of it for our Iron contract [and] for some contingent\nexpences [sic] of Office I have been obliged to make advances for since\nmy supplies of cash failed. This, however must be as circumstances\nwill admit.\nI have heard some rumours [sic] that Mrs. Greene is on\nthe way hither. From my own opinion, strongly corroborated\nby your friends from the Southward, [and] those in this Town, we shall\nendeavour [sic] to convince her that it is best to proceed no farther. We shall\nbe happy in her company here as long as we can make this Town\nagreeable to her, and I have plenty of house-room to spare her.\nIf, however she should determine to proceed, we will endeavour to\naccomodate [sic] her in it. In either case I will furnish her with what \nmoney she shall choose to take.  While you are kept out of\nCharleston, Carolina must be an inconvenient residence for her\nwithout taking into consideration the unavoidable difficulties and\ninconveniences of this Journey, which are dreadful in idea, [and] must\nbe worse in practice to a lady. If you should crown your career\nof success by the possession of Charleston, you may, like Alexander,\nmourn that you have nothing more to conquer – and in that case\nyou will, of course as I take it, come to the northward.\nI am obliged to write this in haste. Having supposed that I\nhad the week before me to write to you I put off the business; but\nthis morning Major Pierce informs me he is to go off at one or\ntwo o'clock [and] the hour is at hand.\nI will\n[End Page 2]\nI will however put in a word or two on our concerns.\nI have before informed you that I had bargained away\nthe 1/8th of the Ship Revolution, the principal part of the paymt.\nwas in meadow lots – the residue not yet rec.d – The ship\nhowever was taken a few days after, so that what we got was \nso much saved.\nThe ship Congress sent in a Brig, which produced the\nOwners little more than [British pounds]2000. After that she put in to Cape\nFrancois [and] contracted a debt of upwards of [British pounds]2000. From whence\nshe went on a cruize intending to send in Prizes to pay the\ndebt. Off of Charleston she fell in with the Savage Sloop of\nwar [a ship near her own size, mounting 16 sixes [and] four\nfours] which she took after an obstinate engagement which\nobliged her to proceed homewards. On the way the prize\nwas retaken by the Solebay Frigate [and] returned to Charleston, so\nthat the Congress returned emptyhanded [and] a good deal mauled.\nAt a meeting of the Owners it was carried by a large ma-\njority that privateering was become ineligible [and] that the\nship should go on a Voyage. This debt in the W. Indies must\nbe paid [and] no way could be found but by sending the ship to\ndo it – She is now loaded [and] will sail in a few days for the \nHavanna – from thence she is to proceed to Amsterdam [and] re\nturn with such property as she creates for the Owners [and] a\nFreight of dry goods.   In the mean time, however, the\nmeadow lots being an useless kind of property to us, [and] wanting\nmuch expence to put them in order, I bartered them away\nfor 1/32d of the Ship Congress; which I intended should be on\nour comp.y account. Mr. Cox declines taking a farther int.r\nin the ship, though he would not consent to sell our original \n1/16th – I therefore requested him to elect for you as to the new\npurchase – he declined it. We therefore decided the matter\nby lot, which gave you this farther concern – that is instead\nof 1/3d. of a sixteenth, you now own 1/3d. of 3/32ds. It shall\nhowever be in your option to take your proportion of\nthis additional 1/32d. or not – you will please to communicate\nyr. determination. It cost [British pounds]500 – that is valuing the ship\nat a [British pounds]16000, subject to the debt abroad [and] the new outfit – She\ncarries about 1900 bar.s of Flour [and] draws a freight of one half\nto the Hav.a from thence to Europe from 1/4 to 1/2 of the\nsugars\n[End Page 3]\nas may happen; [and] from Amsterdam hither about 10 pCent in\ndry goods if the war should continue – She equals our expectations\nin point of sailing, that is, beats everything; but carries too little for\nher size [and] force. Mr. Cox at present declines making any insur.e\non the orig.l 1/16. but I have thought of making some on the addit.l\n32d. especially if it rests all on me – Will you have any? The prin[cipal]\nwill be about 40 pCt. round.\nThe Iron Works have finished their blast. The prospect of\npeace makes me doubtful whether to prepare for another at a\nwar expence, which is at least 50 pCt. more than that of peace.\nThe forge is in forwardness [and] will be ready to work in 2 months or\nless.  I find the business so heavy [and] requiring so much attention\n[and] skill [on which the profits entirely depend] [and] the difficulties so\ngreat of getting proper hands [and] seeing that every thing draws righ[t]\nthat I am under strong temptations to sell out if it can be done.\nIf I could get an owner interested who understood it [and] would ma[ke]\nit his business I would gladly keep a concern; but I am not su[f]\nficiently skilled in it myself to make it either your interest or\nmine to bestow the trouble it requires to keep it going extensive[ly]\nYet it is an estate I have an attachment to, [and] my mind recoils a[t] \nthe serious thought of parting with it.\nI fear being too late with my letter [and] therefore must\ncut it short – Mr. Reed writes to you himself [and] therefore\nI can with the more ease avoid political subjects.\nBelieve me with firm affection\nDr Sir\nYour most obt. Servt. [obedient Servant]\nC. [Charles] Pettit\t\t\t\t\n[Endorsed on the right margin:]  From Col.o [Colonel] Pettit\nNovr. [November] 2d 1781\n[End Page 4]"
