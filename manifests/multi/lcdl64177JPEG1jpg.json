The Horse charged [and] took\nthe Pickett, consisting of a Sergt. Corporal [and] 12 without having\na shot fired at them. two Yagers were kiled [sic], three Pioneers\none Waggon [and] Six Horses taken; we remaind [sic] in Ambush for\nthree Hours, but finding Arnold did not chase to venture out\n[and] not caring to risk an Action in the night with my Riflemen\nI movd back to a place of Security; where I remaind untill [sic] the\n20th.. when having rec.d intelligence, that you were hard pushd\nby Cornwallis, I took possession of a Strong Camp in the \nrear of Suffolk, where I intended to Leave 900 Militia Men\n[and] selected 600 Riflemen [and] 400 Musketry, to March to your\nAssistance if necessary. Should it be found unnecessary, I sho[uld]\n[End Page 1]\nmove down again upon the Lines imediately [sic] – Enclosd I\ndo myself the Honor to transmit you a pretty exact\nAccount of The Enemys Line in this State – I must\nacknowledge it is derogatory to the Honor of the State to suffer\nsuch a handfull of men to retain possession so long – but\nwhat my Dear General is to be done – They are strongly\nfortified – I have near two Thousand men, among the whole\nabout 300 Bajonetts [and] two Brass Six pounders, with\nSuch a Military apparatus we Cannot think of Attacking\nthe works by regular approaches, [and] all my hopes at\npresent are, that I shall be able to coop up Arnold so\nclose, that he will be obligd to make an attempt to\ndislodge us – General Gregory of the North Carolina\nMilitia is now moving down on the east side of the\nDismal Swamp with about 700 Men, in order to\ncut off Arnolds Communication with Princess Ann\nCounty – Should any thing Materiel occur\nI shall do myself the Honor to give Sir imediate [sic]\nNotice:\t\t\tI have the Honor to be\nwith great respect\nDear General\nYour humbl [and] Obedt Servt [Your humble and Obedient Servant]\nP.Muhlenberg [Peter Muhlenberg]\n[Addressed:]  Honble\nMajor General Greene\nCommander in Chief of the Southern Army\nMuhlenberg\n[End Page 2]\n[Endorsed through the address:] from Genl [General] Muhlenberg\nFeb: [February] 24th, 1781\n[Endorsed upside down]: from Genl.
