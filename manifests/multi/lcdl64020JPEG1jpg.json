      "value": "Charleston 29th July 1818 My dear Mary, I received your letter of the 23rd yesterday and was glad to hear that Mr. Smith had receivd his drinkables and was pleased with them, I hope that he will spend many merry hours with his frolicsome companions over his Chateau Margeau. Bythewood arrived on Sunday last, I receiv'd letters from Mama and Betsy by him, he is to sail the first fair wind, I hope that I shall be able to send all their articles by him, I never receivd Sallys letter until yesterday, I shall go out this morning and look for the Childrens frocks, Betsys bonnets are to be finished to day and every thing else is ready.- As I have not written very lately to Beaut I suppose you all begin to think that we were cast away on our passage to Sullivans Island, I had always predicted that some accident would happen to me, and was really astonished when we landed, to find that we had had a delightful passage down and I not at all frighten'd, - we had engaged Jones' carriage, which was ready for us, and we had a very pleasant ride up to the house, but as soon as Mr. Heyward stept out of the Carriage the Horses without any apparent cause began to kick violently, dashed off with the Carriage ran up against a tree which stopt them, and my Lady ship [End Page 1] who had been in the Carriage screaming the whole time, took a fair leap out at the door, to the great admiration of all the bystanders and I do not now consider myself, at all inferior to Mrs. W. Morris. Mrs. Means I thought looked very ill, and had been very sick indeed since her removal to the Island, they all appear'd very anxious to get away from Jones', they soon discovered that a tavern was not the place for their children, who were improving in the accomplishment called rudeness, Robert and Dun dined at table every day, and appeared to be perfectly at their ease, and strange to tell cousin Sally says she feels perfectly at home now among strangers Meg had seen a great many persons from town, and appear'd to be more pleased with Mrs. J. Pringle than any of them, however Mrs. Means said she had dampened her spirits very much by telling them that they may travel all over the Northern states, and not meet with so delightful a house as Jones', which they thought to be a miserable prospect indeed. I saw Uncle Wigg down there also, he looks as well as I ever saw him, and his Son they tell me is a very fine boy. They all sailed in the Georgia Packet and from the wind will probably have a delightful passage. Your old neighbour Mrs. J. Richardson lives just behind us, I have never seen her but in her Carriage I observe that she has grown very thin, her Sister H. Fraser stays with her, you know I was never acquainted with her, so I have not been to visit her. We have just had an invitation from Mrs. Robertson to tea this evening, but as Mr. Heyward is going to the [End Page 2] Island and I to shop with my Mother, I was obliged to refuse very much against my inclination.- -do give my love to Sister, I have not seen any of her Sisters but once since she left town but I believe they are all quite well, remember me also to Mama and all my friends, does Elizabeth still look pale and thin? my Children are all quite well. Nat is learning to talk very fast, Edward guesses at a few letters in the Alphabet and James has four teeth, I think this is giving you a very favorable account of your little Nephews. Mr. Heyward is quite well and desires to be remembered to you with my most affectionate compliments to Mr. Smith I remain your Affectionate Sister Hetty B. Heyward P.S. I receivd $20 in Mamas letter and $50 in Betsys. [End Page 3] Mrs. John J. Smith Beaufort South Carolina [End Page 4]"
