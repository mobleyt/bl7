      "value": "Charleston 29th Nov. 1816 My Dear Mother I have looked in vain for a carriage which I supposed would suit you; nor is it possible to have one made without considerable expense.- Say $400- without the harness- which would be 50 more.- As I did not anticipate so large a sum, I would not order it without your approbation-- I believe it possible to have a carriage made by an inferior workman at a lower rate, but these would be so liable to be out of order, [and] the inconvenience of having them repaired would be so great in Beaufort, that I think it would be better to give $100 more and have it faithfully built.-I think if you can manage to make the old coach hold out a little longer, that Edward or myself might be successful in our next visit to Charleston.- We propose returning to the country tomorrow, and shall be steady until January.--After [End Page 1] that I suspect we shall be very fidgety until March.-Our son Edward continues as healthy, and as bad as ever.-Nat has been vaccinated lately, [and] has taken very finely.-No inflammation, however has produced a little fever, and makes him look quite pale. We have been very dissipated in town, and long to return to rustic amusements, and regular hours.-I shall send as usual to Pocotaligo Post Office where we anticipate frequent letters from Beaufort-- Hetty is [out? not?] visiting as usual, but I suppose I must join her love with mine to all the family I remain Yr. ever Affectionately N. Heyward Junr. [End Page 2] Mrs. Mary Barnwell Beaufort So. Ca. [End Page 3]"
