We have had a heavy fall of snow-- every thing looks as in Ohio-- the roofs of the houses with a heavy coat of beautifully white snow-- the trees & landscape in [general?], looking beautifully pure-- & we with our [Comfortably?] fire within listening to the sleet as it rattles against the windows--. But how I pity the suffering poor who have not a sufficiency of food & Clothing-- & not even a comfortable shelter. Our \"Lord tempers the wind to the shorn Lamb\"-- & I hope they Know how to make their [merit?] of their privations & sufferings. I wonder if you are preaching today-- it is now-- near Eleven OClock-- I hope you will have a good Collection also to begin the year with, or [written on side of page:] Little Sallie [illegible] has just heard from her mother-- whose infant is very low-- her Sister seems delighted with the [illegible] of [Lan-?],[End Page 1] rather to Conclude the old year--. I am beginning to look around for more bedsteads & single mattresses to suit-- we have had applications or talk of three Pupils beside little Ellis-- viz -- Miss Hagood of Barnwell-- Miss Simmons of Augusta-- & you Know about Miss Bonneau of Charleston of whom Miss [Cunningham?] wrote. I will send Mr Devereux of Raleigh our [reduced?] circulars when out-- I enclose our terms for your inspection & approval, & will be very much obliged if you will write me your answer at your earliest convenience as others are awaiting my reply--. Please give me if you can too, the address of the person in Paris to whom I should address myself about the loan-- Perhaps Mr [illegible] B. Lafitte could be of some assistance in that matter-- It was the Visitation Convent of Paris that loaned the Ursulines of B.C. the money they used in building,-- & Sr Etiene will be very much obliged for the address of Empress Eugenie[End Page 2] to whom the Visitation Nuns of Mobile applied, & who sent them a donation-- (we hear a handsome one)--. We, can do nothing more in this Country, so must try elsewhere-- What about Jones--? He might as well return his papers to you & find some other employment than living off us--. I'm tired of [him?],-- the mean fellow--! You will be pleased to learn that we have heard again from Tuscaloosa, & our Sisters write very satisfactorily-- They have secured servants for next year-- sr Josephine has had a chill since we left, but was better-- do pray for them & especially for health for Sr J-- if it be A.M.D.G. We have recd a very pleasing letter from Miss Nannie Nicholson whom we expect at any time-- & another from [illegible: Sister?] Frances whose visit is deferred for a few weeks-- we think they will both remain with us-- nothing from the Lay Sr Postulant but hope she will come-- When may we expect the pleasure of seeing you-- & what about our building--? Don't forget Confirmation of Children -- & to give Rev Dr the [illegible] to erect [stations?] properly--.[End Page 3] I did not intend to write on this page, but when I begin to talk to you, I never Know when to stop. All join me in very aff. & grateful respects & wishes of a \"Happy New Year & many joyous returns, with the means of giving great glory to Almighty God-- I will not give you any family news-- as no doubt you hear as often as I do-- Anna & Francis have both written to me--. & I am truly thankful that our dear Parents continue so well--. How the sleet patters against the glass--! God bless you my dearest Brother-- Take good care of Yourself-- Give to us all your Benediction-- especially to-- Your own Sister Ellen. Sr Baptiste. Sup. This is my 3rd or 4th letter since my return. But I don't expect an answer to [half?].[End Page 4]"
