      "value": "May 27, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nThe pictures of Bo arrived this morning and I was amazed \nby her resemblance to Sarah Jane. They really look amazingly alike.\nIs'nt it curious how family resemblances run in families. I can\nunderstand children looking like their parents but when Aunts and\nUncles come into the picutre I am always a little bit puzzled.\nThe little Phipps boy looks just like his father and\nI am certain he is pink and white and will look like a pig under\na gate by the time he is nine. They were all very cute sitting there\nby the side of thepool, and reminded me of a couple of puppy dogs.\nThere is one picture of Lester sitting in a garden with Tom Evans.\nIs that your garden[,] because it is enormous and looks very attractive.\nI like the wall and do hope that there are lots of flowers and nice\nthings to lend it charm. The pictures of the Field Marshall are\nwonderful. He belongs at Medway, has that worn lookXabout the face,\nand the general thiness of the southerner. In fact if you had not\nwritten that it was Dill I ould have thought it was John Gadsden['s]\nbrother. Tony was w nderful. Certainly no one would ever accuse\nhim of being a throughbred. The general impression I gathered from the \npictures of Medway that I have seen[,] was a run down at the heel\nplace whose troubles were mirrored on the faces of those there. Walter\nwho was standing behind Reggie had the most terrfied expression on his\nface as if he expected Tony to drop in his tracks, something I must\nadmit I was a little firghtened of also when I looked at those legs\nand lowered head.\nLittle Ann looked so attractive in her picture. She has\nreally turned into a most attrXactive looking girl, and I should\nthink you would feel very happy that you had given her such a chance\nin life. It probably xxxxx has made her entire view point different[,]\nand where she would have lived in her little group in New Orleans\nthinking it was the only one in the city she now realizes that it\ntakes a great many people to make the world, and that many of them\nare more attractive than the ones she will find in the deep south.\nArmant is going to San Pedro which is ver[y]near Los Angles.\nOne of our Yeoman tells me that it is a most attractive place with\na climate that is unbeatable and swimming that keeps you in the water\nwhenever you have the opportunity. It may fascinate him so that\nhe will want to live there the rest of his life away from the heat\nand bad climate of New Orleans, so that after all his [not] comming out here\nwas for the best. We were terribly sorry that he could not make it,\nespecially when it was all so close, but all hope [illegible] at the end.\nOther Officers were sent here and therefor we had no grounds to ask\nfor him.\nGoodbye darling, all my love. Sidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
