      "value": "For Dibbe plan A  To The News and Courier:\"  In the last several months, Mutitudinous wprdage has been pro- \"  duced regarding our Smith-Dibb  traffic plan, which has become the  King street merchants\" plan.  A vast, amount of it has been  nonsensica mouthinge; a considerable portion has bordered upon If  not penerated into, the idiotic. Anyone who has ived in Charleston  for years and who possesses a  modicum of common sense will  agree that the Smith Dibbe .plan  was the best thing that ever happened   to   Charleston.  One of the best expression, if  not the best; ever to appear In  the Public prints regarding it -was  a letter by the Rev. Maynard Marsha in The News and Courier of  March 13. Here indeed, was common sense; here indeed, was the  truth of the matter. He undoubtedy expressed the thoughts and opinions of hundreds and thousands of  people in Charleston who either  were incapable of putting their  thoughts on paper or were disincined to do; so. He should be congratuated without limit or quaification. Two of the paragraphs in  his item should have been printed in capita etters. There were,  paragraphs 12 and 16. [ook them  up and read them again]  No. 12 refers to the objections of  the \"merchants\", two of whom on  on the committee are lifeong  friends of mine, No. 16 is pain, unaduterated common sense, a quality  which seems a but extinct today.  The writer has traded with Ker-  rison\"s, egerton\"s, James Aan\"s,  Feder\"s barber shop, azarus, etc.  a his life. If he wants something  which they can furnish, what difference does it make whether traffic on King street - goes north?  Answer - NONE. He goes to Feder\"s for a haircut; egerton\"s for  what is offered there; azarus for  a screwdriver and James Aan\"s  for an aarm cock [or wedding  present].  This is a vote for the Smith-  Dibbe plan as originay tried [not  the  merchants\"   plan].  AEXANDER   SPRUNT.  JR.  The Crescent.  O  :amp;gt; z  0 0  a w  01  :  W  ___   -1  1  tt  9- amp;t;  \"a i  o    The Ways and Means Committee  of City Counci, meeting last night  in .the mayor\"s office, approved  purchase of two properties in Archdae Street for municipal parking  ots.. One, including an old fire  engine house, would be bought  from Kenneth T. Ohenger for  $16,000 and the other from J. .  Pressman\" for $7,500.  An appropriation of up to $4,000  for constructing a sewer Line in  Barre Street was approved.  also approved was a payment of  $2,774.47 to the State Highway Department for abor and materias  for construction of ockwood Drive.  On motion of Mayor William  McG. Morrison, the committee directed the city engineer to prepare  pats of a city-owned ands, including the new ets created by  fiing ijj areas along the Ashley  River. The atter and will be offered   for   sae.  It also was decided to negotiate  for Additional and, to widen Chinquapin Street between Cannon and  Bee Streets to 50 feet.  The committee voted to recommend that the 1951 audit5 be awarded to William F. Muckenfuss and  Associaltes, who \"have been doing  the, work for several years, on a  per diem basis instead of on a bid.  This was done because the firm  said it would not bid this year in  accordance with action taken by  the   auditors\"   associaltion.  City Council will meet\" at 7  o clock tonight in the Council chamber in city ha."
