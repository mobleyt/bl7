      "value": "AIR MAIL COPY\nZANDER [and] COMPANY. INC.\n413-417 GRAVIER STREET\nNEW ORLEANS, LA.\nFeb 24 th 1943.\nLt. S.J.Legendre,\nBox 166 Navy Yard,\nPearl Harbor, T.H.\nDear Sid-\nI'm sending this in duplicete- one air-mail end one regular-- to be sure you\nget et least one copy , as I gather from some of your remarks that some of my letters\nmight heve gone astray.\nI got your air-mail letter of the Feb 15 last night. I hevent written you since\nI talked to you onthe phone on Sunday Feb 14 , as each day I figured I would be\nhearing from you. I was just about to write you yesterday when your letter arrived.\nIt sure was welcome because I was beginning to think something had gone wrong. Whilst\nI havent heard anything from Washington as yet, I'm sure everything should be okay\nunless the big shot doesnt like my record when you checks it over. It is nothing to be\nproud of! It will show thet I started off on the Suwannee as \"1St Lt.\" and after a\nmonth or so I was supplented by a Lt Comdr. who arrived by plane--- I imagine at the\nurgent request of our Captain ! I was then made \" 1 st Division \" officer, under the\nGunnery Officer, and I was not the Gunnery Officer, as you state in your memorandum.\nI mention this because if Washington calls this to your boss's attention , you can\nadvise his that this was unknown to you.\nThere are a few other discrepencies in your memo which I dont think are\nimportant but nevertheless think I had better mention them in case of any \"come-back\".\nI was born June 17 1899 [not 1898]\nI was not All-American-but on Camps second team[Bob Phillips always said\nthis was an \"undue technicelity!\"] I especially mention this as if\nyour commading officer is a demon on memory, he will know thet I was\nnot an All-American and may think we ere trying to pull a \"fast one\".\nI am not working in the Personell office here but in \"Office of Naval\nOfficer Procurement\". It is of course under the Bureau of Personnell.\nI had a \"B.A,\" degree from Princeton--not a \"B.S.\"\nNow here is the only point I consider important.\nYou state in \"5\"-- \"knee is now stiff and he has been advised further\nsea duty is not possible\". If I wrote you that, I was wrong. Of course\nyou may have access to some confidential files that I dont know about,\nand in which I have been declared unfit for sea duty. If so, I myself\nhave never been so advised. Here is the story as far as I know it-\nWhen I returned to the Norfolk Hospital Jan 14[ a day or so after\ntalking to you on the phone from Gerties] I told the Dr that if I couldnt\ngo to sea fro a month or so, I would like to go to a training school and\nthat if he would discherge me from the hospital, I thought I could get\nsomeone in the Personnel office in Washington to send me to a school.\nThe Dr said that I wasnt ready for xxxxxx sea yet but that he wasnt\n[End Page 1]\nAIR MAIL COPY\nZANDER [and] COMPANY. INC.\n413-417 GRAVIER STREET\nNEW ORLEANS, LA.\npermitted to give me a discharge from the hospital to the effect that I was fit\nxxxxxxxxxonly to go to a school. He would either have to give me a full dischare or\nnothing-and of course I would have to take my chance of being sent directly to sea.\nI said I would take my chances. So he discharged me. But then instead of sending me\nto a school, the guy in Washington sent me home on two weeks leave with orders to\nreport to Com 8 in New Orleans on Feb 12 for \"temporary duty pending further assignment\nby the Bureau\". In the meatime the Procurement Office big shot had heard I was on\ntown and he wired Washington asking for me and I was then assigned to that office and\nthat where I am now.\nNow whether Washington intended to leave me in Procurement or send me to sea as\nsoon as they thought my knee could take it, I of course cant tell. My own hunch is\nthat the Guy in Washington thought I was too dam old to go to a school but he was\nnice enough not to send me right back to sea as he had seen my knee and I guess he\nknew that I couldnt take it yet. On the other handsxxx he may have had some correspondence\nwith the hospital--of which I know nothing-- and has decided that I'm worthless for\nfurther sea duty.\nThe reason I go into all this lenghthy explanation is because your statement\nabout my being 'unfit' may think I'm trying to shirk sea duty. Frankly I dont think\nthis knee will stand sea duty in its present condition and I cant tell how long it will\nbe before it is okay. It is not getting strong very fast. It did the first part of\nthe actual healing swell but the rebuilding of the muscles is coming along pretty\nslow. I can walk plenty far but I cant run or turn sharp corners or go up and donw\nladders without It hurting. It lent \"stiff\"--quite the contrary, it wobbles all over\nthe dam place! I'm in hopes that If I get out with you guys and get some good sun\nand swimming, that it will get okay In a hurry. Then if they want to send me back to\nthe Suwannee or anything else It okey doke by me, although if its as wonderfull as you\nsay , I'll probably fight and scream if they try and tear me away!\nWell so much for all that-- now let me tell you how much I appreciate all the\nwork you have dons to help me get there. I really cant think of anything I would\nrather do than be with you. I never even thought of it last spring or summer because\nI didnt think such a thing could be possible. Frankly I had \"such little faith\" in\nour Fuhrer that I dindt think he could keep even the two of you together. Of course\nI am now a \"convert\" to the Fuhrer and realize that absolutely nothing is impossible\nfor him to accomplish. Seriously though, you guys must have done a swell job out there\nto have gotten so much drag with you Commanding Officer. Congratulations!\nPerhaps you re thinking that I as foolish to even want to once again stray\naway from N O and leqve Olive and the children. I am doing it will Olives full consent.\nIt so happens that there is one type of duty I dont crave in the Navy[I mean besides\nProcurement! ] and there is a certain Capt that is trying to get me under xx his\ncommnad. Olive figures that \"of the two evils\" she prefers ny being with you two!\n[End Page 2]\nAIR MAIL COPY\nZANDER [and] COMPANY. INC.\n413-417 GRAVIER STREET\nNEW ORLEANS, LA.\nPage [number]3\nThanks for all the infomation regarding clothes needed. However I think I will\nbring all the Navy clothes that I have because some fine day they may transfer me to\nthe Aleutians or Siberia.\nI am trying not to count too much on everything going thru okay, so that if\nanything goes wrong I wont be too dissapointed. I sure have ny fingers crossed and\neach morning when I go to that dam Procurement office I rush thru the mail looking\nfor \"orders\". But If something does go wrong, please let me know as soon as\npossible, as I have something else I want to get started working on. Its nothing\nas swell as your proposition but it is an improvement over Procurement. By the way--\nwho do you think is my immediate superior at Procurement ? None other than Nat!\nI got back at him the other day however by taking him out on a P.C. boat and letting\nhim fall down a few hatches.\nBy the way--just so you wont think you are foisting a \"cripple\" on your\nCommanding Officer, let me haste to reassure you that this knee doesnt hinder my\nworking in the least--just so I'm not expected to run! Outside of the knee I an\nIn fine shape and can drink almost two whiskeys without passing out.\nAs soon as I hear something definite I will write you. I dont guess there is\nany use in my cabling because I understand my last cable never reached you.\nWell so long guys--I sure have my fingers crossed- and thanks again for all your\ntrouble\nArma\n[End Page 3]"
