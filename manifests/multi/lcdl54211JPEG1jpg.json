      "value": "Camp Norman, North Island February 16th 1861 Dear Wife I have just finished up my 24 Hours duty and having got my Breakfast and driven the Sleep out of my eyes, I will do what I promised in my last letter to you to write a long Letter. The Chance for writing however is Very bad indeed, so much noise, all hands in One small room, and all hands talking more especially Jo Sarvis who is the funny boy of our mess and Grissett and Buck the too laughing members. In the first place I am s satisfied with my place in the Company and satisfied with Camp life. We are suffering for some of the necessities of life, perhaps they are only what we were used to as luxeries [luxuries]. People in our places cannot and must not expect to meet with all the good things of life, if they do they are not fit for soldiers and ought to go Home and let their Mothers come and do duty. I tell you now that before I would say or do anything\n[End Page 1]\nthat would tend to injure the Company or disgrace my District, I would with my own right hand make you a Widow and my children orphans. I write this way to you Melly not knowing what the other members of the Company may write home, but I am uneasy for fear that you will hear of trouble and dissatisfaction amongst some, and they our own name and relations, that is what gets me. It is the duty of all privates in a Company when in Camp to take their regular turns at Standing Guard, the Officers are exempt from this, but have other duties to perform, that are much worse. On yesterday Evening the Guard for this day and Night were called off and notified of the duty they were expected to perform. Now in drawing off the Guard from the Roll they are taken Alphabetically that is all the As will come together and all the Bs then\tthe Cs and so on down until the roll is exhausted, then they commence at the top again and go through in the same way, do you understand it? Yes. Well, we have men enough in our\n[End Page 2]\nCompany to make this Guard duty very light it only comes once in 3 1/3 days. Sam Beaty, John M Beaty, S C Beaty, James E Beaty, W T Bond, F G Burroughs all being Bs come together on this duty. they stood guard the first night after we organized and named the Camp (Tuesday night) they were drawn off to Stand again from 8 o'clock this morning to 8 o'clock Am tomorrow. Now Sam Beaty, you know Melly is very smart and remarkably good in figures, and having ascertained that if all the men in Camp were to stand Guard, his turn would not have come until tomorrow, so after dismission from Drill he congregated about 20 of the men around him and Swore that he would not obey Orders, this so pleased Cornelius that he had the insolence to tell Capt Norman in the presence of some of his men that \"we had too many officer.\" Norman Ordered him to his Quarters. This kind of talk will ruin Sam or the Company one for unless all orders from the Captain are obeyed we will never do anything I have made up my mind, if there is to be a contest between Order and Disorder I shall fight and fall in the side of Order.\n[End Page 3]\n(9 1/2 O'clock AM) Sam went out on Guard Duty this morning He was placed on the line back of the Captains quarters. Col Alston has just passed in, the Guards have all saluted him with the usual Honors, except Sam he disobeyed, the Sentinels are all pacing their lines with the regular tramp of Soldiers Except Sam he is sitting on a Stump that marks the end of his line. Disobeying orders pity pity. I feel sorry for his Fathers feelings I feel sorry for his two Brothers who are in Camp and will do duty unless they are otherwise influenced. I feel sorry for the one third of the members of the Company to whom he is related, but upon his head be the consequences, if he is sent home under arrest and read out of the Service, and it is published, the printer, must be very particular in Spelling names. I was up all night on duty and held a consultation with Norman about this matter, he is mortified, but at the same time as firm as a Rock, and his officers and men will stand by him.\n[End Page 4]\nI got the bolster you sent me or was it Carrie? it was very acceptable anyhow, as my old over coat kept slipping from under my head and getting under Bucks or Taylors. I slept on the other side till my neck got crooked, tonight I will Bolster it up a little. Well now about the Cooking. It ain't so bad after all, especially as  I don't have it to do. Bob Clark is a good\tCook Cleanly. Keeps his things clean and nice, is obedient, good natured and always\tready, he is a deserving Boy and if he holds out as he has commenced, I intend to see if the State cannot do something for his future benefit. And now about the place, it is a bleak barren row of sandhills exposed to the Ocean on one side and Winyah Bay on the other, very much in appearance like Cherry Grove only the backwoods looks better, being Covered with a thick Grove of Pine and Palmetto, very hilly and broken and a most Capital place for Riflemen to Skirmish. I think if our men were well drilled, we could\n[End Page 5]\nrender a good account from this same Island, in Honor of Harry. I hope however that we will all get home safely, but no one I hope will falter from a contest if it has to come. I shan't I am sure. I do hope you are all well, and doing well if I could only know this and know it as often as I wish, I would be happy and perfectly content this is the only thing that ever troubles me but I feel that you are in the hands of a higher Power than me, that rules all things and rules for the best, this must suffice me. You must let me finish with some thing for the children in another letter. I shall write you every day or every other day and trust to luck for your getting my letters singly or all at a time. Good by God Bless you my Wife John R Beaty Ned is well, doing well, behaves well.\n[End Page 6]"
