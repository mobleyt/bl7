Carolina  at one [and]\nthe Same time, the disafected [sic] party Rising in arms\nin So many parts of that State at this season of\nthe year when their Cropps are on Hand Rather\nIncourages me to think an attack is Intended\nto be maid Ther [sic] in this State of So. Carolina\nAltho I should Supppose the Season of the year\nwold discourage them from such an Expedition\nShould the Militia be drawn into actual\nService, their operations will be greatly Retarded\nfor want of Money to purchase many articles –\nand to Hyre others which is Nessessary to Equip\nthe people in order for a march, the article of\nGunflints will also be much Wanting in this\nBrigade, I shold also think it advisable that\nSome person be Emediatily Imployed to have\na Quantitiy of lead Cast into Sisable Bullets [and]\nBuck shot, as it is proble the Call will be sudden\nI doe not at present Knowe who has the Custody of\nthe Military Stores at Newbern or what Stores there\nthere is at that place, in Case your Excellency shold\nbe under the nescessity of Ordering Out the Militia\n[End Page 2]\nHope you will be particular in the Orders [and]\nAssertain as Near as possible the Number you\nwold wish shold march from this dist.r\nthat they may be properly proportioned to \nEach County, however I Expect Craven Dobbs\n[and] Pill [Pitt] must bear the Burthen.\nI am at present Very poorley with a Violent\nCold I took on the Road, and Renued after\nI Got home by Washing myself in warm –\nWater, so that I am afraid I cannot be at\nthe muster in Dobbs, if I shold find my\nSelf amended so as to be able to Ride with\nSafety to my Self I will be up\nI am Sir your Excellency's Most Obed.t [Obedient]\nand Very Huml [Humble] Servant\nWm [William] Bryan\n[P.S.]\nNB\nYour Letter to Capt.
