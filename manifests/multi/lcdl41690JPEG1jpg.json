      "value": "College of Combree 24 April 1860 My dear Parents I commence this letter with a trembling hand and beating heart because I have just escaped from a great danger. I will tell you the cause. I exspect that you remember that when I was at Charle's College I was sick with the constipation of the bowels, last Sunday after high-mass I felt like going to the privy (although I had not been there for 7 days before.) My dear Parents my conscience would not be at ease if I would not tell you every thing as it happened although I beg of you not to be troubled about it as it has all passed over. Well then I went to the privy and after staid a 1/4 of an hour without success but with much sufferings I concluded to start out but what was my surprise I trying to stand upp (I will speak plainly because I[End Page 1] know that I am speaking to my dear parents) that I could not. the stuff that had rested so long a time in my stomach had become hard and moulded (?) and also had inflamed my bowels so that nothing could come out but the force of the gripes which I had would make it commence but then it would come no farther nor recede. I was obliged to go half bent to the infirmirie and took an injection immediately but it only made me suffer more and I had such sharp gripes that I was obliged to scream. When the gripes passed over I was put to bed and took two table-spoons full of castor's oil but it had no effect at all. That evening the doctor of the College ordered a hot bath which did me no good, and the next evening I took a hot bath in a sitting position which had the desired effect for[End Page 2] in four hours I had had a good passage although with much suffering. My dear Parents I have two things to ask you and I hope that you will not refuse neither the one of the other. The first is that father will write a letter to Mr James Owens at our college to thank him for his kind attention to me during my sickness, for when I was alone in the privy suffering he came always to take care of me and would continue to rub my back untill the gripes would pass. It was he also who went for the doctor for me although it was pouring down rain. His direction is the same as mine except his name which is James B. Owens. The second request is that you will send me the salve that you used to put on the children's heads to drive[End Page 3] away the lice I do not know the name but I know that you were very careful that their heads should not be wet. I think that you could send it very easily in a letter. I think that you will be surprised but you will be more so when I tell you that I get up often in the night to comb my head but with all that I cannot run them off. I hope you will send it in your next. I will write a letter to Aunt Louisa and Grand-Parents this week. Last week I have been the forth in composition of Greek out of 28. I finish my letter as I wish to have some of my work finished for tomorrow although I have the permission. Kiss Brothers and Sisters for me and all my dear relations remember me also to the negroes and pray for your obedient son Robert Lynch[End Page 4]"
