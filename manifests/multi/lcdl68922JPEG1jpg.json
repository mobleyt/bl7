      "value": "May 26th '43\nDear Sidney,\nMy trip to the Ball Game with the Dills and Field\nMarshall Sir Archibald Wavell was great fun. He had never seen\nbaseball before and everyone explained it to him from all sides.\nKate Smith sang over the microphone, Babe Ruth made a speach for\nwar bonds, Bing Crosby cruned and Wavell was made to take a bow. He got\nmore applause than all the other stars put together and had to\nwalk out on the field and say a few words over the microphone. We\nsat in the box with Knox and Baruch and the seats were incidently\n$1000 war bond seats. A gift of the Washington Post- Mr Eugene Mayer.\nThe game made two million dollars in bonds that night. It was\nquite a show and I enjoyed the whole spaectacle. Mrs Mark Clark was\nin the party,and a sprinkling of aides to hold off the autograph\nseekers that swarmed about.\nYesterday afternoon Tony Frissell and I went to the\nDills at tea time to take some photos of the Big Shots. They were\nso sweet about it, and we laughed alot as we exploded bulbs in their\nfaces. We told them it was for posterity for all our albums. They\nwill not be used publicly of course. I think the whole mission must be\npretty tired for they have had conferences from morning to night[,]and whe[n]\nthey get all through they have to be interviewed by newspaper men from\n45 states who are waiting to fire questions. However to my surprise they\nall seem to think the Washington climate is fine. I guess thats polite\ntalk,or else its fine by comparison to India.\nI was awake last night at 2 A.M. and thought about you\njust about ready for bed at nine o'clock your time. My how I wish\nI were with you darling. Its the old theme. you will be so used to your\nbachlor life and living apart,I wonder howyou will feel when the day\nfinally arrives and we are again united. Time marches on[,]and I only \nwish it would go faster so we could get this war over with. It\nstretches on and on like groping through a long dark corridor and\nnever getting to the end of it.\nI wonder if you had a nice Sunday on the beach and if\nDuke Konimoko was out on his board riding the waves like a panther.\nIt is always too late to get tennis after working hours so I have not\nplayed at all since last year. To and from the office is my only\nbreath of air and exercise. Gasolene has completly stopped. No taxi's\n-few busses[,]and all the gas ta[n]ks dry. I see no hope of Chevey Chase\neven on Sunday.\nI am getting an other recruit into my office[not till July]\nbut even that will help. A girl called KatyLou Crunden I went to school\nwith twenty three years ago[,]and have not seen since. Miss Charlotte got\nher for me and she is a peach. That is real luck. My pal Miss Fearson\nis leaving for the west coast the end of June and is taking the other\ntypist with her, This makes matters very tough and they will be hard to\nreplace. There just are no good girls anymore.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nDoes the Navy out there use Waves for typists and clerical\nnot the way they do in the Navy Department?\nThere is a terrific shortage of WAACS and WAVES in all branches\nand recruiting is not any too successful_to date- so I am told.\nI cant resign and join the WAACS,and if Idid I would probably end\nbaking bread in Texas. I am in hopes I shall get to the Pacific\nin time with this outfit as I think there is a pretty good chance\nsomething will develop along those lines. I am going to work on\nthat possability. Its too late now to be interested in the other\ndirection- thats the way I feel any how.\nIts the most beautiful day out to-day. It rained torrents\nall night so the air is clear and the sun is shining and I wish\nI were in the country under the trees.\nI wonder how Morris is getting on. I hope O.K. now.\nI have taken a cottage at Watch Hill-for the children so Honey\ncan go too. I got a house with 4 bedrooms and two baths and a maids\nroom. A lawn, etc.Its sounds fine and only costs $900 for the\nseason. I think they will be much happier and I shall try and\npersuade Candice to go up and cook for them.\nI got my air conditioner insat[a]lled by a fluke of luck.\nWe telephoned every company in town.They a l said \"impossible,too\nbusy\" One day two men came to the house- said they had come to\ninstall airconditioners, Rose put them to work,when theywere all\nthrough and took the address down they realized they had worked\nall day at the wrong house. Rose had a good laugh and they did\ntoo. We might have waited all summer for them, now someone else\nwill be the unlucky ones. Pretty funny! and typical of life in\nWashington.\nDo you get a stiff neck and a stiff back from sitting\ndown all day? I feel so stiff and ache all over.My fanny is getting\nas big as Nanny Tiffany's,and I shall waddle stiffly as I walk\nwaddle to meet that incomming plane at the end of the war when\nyou came back to the U.S.A.\nI dream about cables and numbers, and paper work all night\nand wonder if you do too. Maybe it cdmes from lack of exercise\nwhich really does relax one- I dont know, but I find sleaping \nvery jumpy these days.\nEnjoy that blue water for me and make an extra splash\nunder the waves when you think of Washington,and the Q Bldg,and\nConstitution Ave.\nAll my love to you sweetheart. Take care of yourself\nand try not to forget [y]our Gertie who loves you very much.\nAlways-\nGertie.\n[End Page 2]"
