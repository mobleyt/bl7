      "value": "R 9 12 44\nAug 29,1944 \nDear Sidney, \nThis has been such a hectic month in the office I have\nnot had time to write any letters. So much has happened in the news-its\nbeen terribly exciting.\nAmong otherthings there was a party at my house for\n\"The Retreads\" of 1918. The flyers,who flew with Bruce Hopper in the last\nwar. This consisted of about a dozen Generals and a few Colonels to boot.\n24 in all. As luck would have it the weather held out with no rain to mar\nthe dinner in the garden. I had a U shape table with very fine flower decor\n-ation, lights in the fig tree, candles on the table and small lights alongh\nthe side of the patio that looked like landing lights on an an field. It\nwas terribly attractive. Spaatz, Anderson, Brereton, McDonald, Royce, Curtis\n-Donavan wereall there to say nothing of loads of others including our\nAmbassador. The speaches were really wonderful, and the army produced the\nbest food you have ever tasted. We started with melon, followed by lobsters\nthan filet mignon,salad, icecream and cake. Coffeein the pine living room-\nWe had a movie called When next I se Paris which hit the nail right on the\nhead as this was the day Paris was liberated,and we were celebrating it too.\nThe picture was perfect- a short one of Old Paris as we all knew it , and\nthen the tred of german solglers over the scene and all the way through a\ngirl's voice singing \"When [next] I see Paris\", then the Allead armies landing\non the coast of France for the liberation. After the short movie Julie 6\nGalespy[my crooning Red Cross girl]sang April in Paris and \"Lele Marlene,\"\nand it was really a perfect evening. I think everyone had a swell time.\nI made everyone sign in my BUZZ BOMB book, and we even had some photos\ntaken by an army photograper which I shall show you some day. Those Big\nShots are all really swell men, and it gives one quite a kick to know the\nwar is being carried out by such able good fellows. I think Spaatz is tops.\nMy Gen. D. made the best speach of all I thought,which\nofcourse was entirely extemporanious,and he speaks so easily its delightful.\nEveryone made good speeches,and drank toasts to the Young Pilots of to-day,\nand the missing ones that had fallen out of formation. we were only three\nwomen at the party. Effie Hopper-Bruce's wife who really gave it, me, and\nJulie Galespie who was staying with me and sang.\nThe next night was Bruce Hopper's birthday so I had\nfour for dinner-Bruce , his wife, Julian Allen, Ted Curtis and Me. I called\nit the\"Retread of the Retread\"and we ate exactly the same dinnerall over\nagain. There was so much left over. Added to that was a birthday cake and\na bottle of wine. I wrote a limerick to him,and I think he loved it. Bruce\nis a history professor at Harvard. He is the Historian for the ninth Air-\nforce over here and a charming man. I got to know them both because it is\nthey that found the house I am in and told me about it. I am staying on\nin it through the month of September which is perfect as I hated the idea\nof having to pack and move out. I believe soon we may all bemoving , andits\na bore to pack twice.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nI had my off weekendthis last week end and went down to Raymond Guest's in\nthe country at Wentworth and played 18 holes of golf Sunday afternoon. Sat\nI went racing at Ascot believe it or not and won fifteen pounds on my bets.\nThe weather was wonderful, really hot andsunny and I lay out in a bathing-\nsuit all Sunday morning and got a terrific burn. Bing Crosby was here too\nand an english girl. We sat on the terrace after dinner and Bing sang to\nus for about two hpurs. It really was perfect. He playes a swell game of\ngolf too.The caddies all had to have his autograph and we had alot of laughs\nover that.\nI am having him to dinner thursday and hope he will play the \npiano [for] us. King Douglas has a ranch next to Bings out at Rancho SantaFe\nso I have King and Adele Astair Cavendish and a few others , and it ought\nto be fun.Do you remember how we liked that country out there?\nTown is very deserted as everyone is on the other side now getting\nin on all the French jubilation and excitement. Being a mere civilian\nfemale I am outcast and much discriminated a last when it comes to going\nanywhere. It never was a help to be a woman iiat I could ever see, and ln\na war least of all. I expect to hear big tales from David and Lester about\nall they have seen. I was offwred a ride to Paris in a jeep the other day\nbut ofcourse was not allowed to swing it. Well so it goes.\nI hear the Jap war is going almost as well as the European one\nand should be over soon too. I hope this is true.\nThe buzzbombs have fallen off considerably due to our accuracy\nwithh ackack, and we have not had nearly as many over as we have had in\nthe past. I amso used to them now- they really dont bother me at all, and\nalthough I sleep entirely alone in the house- I sleep very well.\nEvery morning as I take my regular route across the corner of \nthe Park, down Hillst. and so to Berkeley Sq. I pass the same big fat old\ncolly lying in an open doorway of a little garden. He is so old he barely\nhas the energy to look up at me when I stop to pat him. He is such a nice\nold freindly animal and I feel so sorry for him as I feel he barely can\ndrag around and might be happier if dead. I wonder what he thinks of the\nbuzzbombs, and glass all over the ground. Talking of glass- you have never\nseen anything like the speed of clearing away debris. It is truly amazing.\nThe day afteran awful mess where glass is thick everywhere and rubble all\nover the street- the AFB people will clean it all up so traffic can pass\nan  almost emmediately others are putting cotton cloth over the gaping windo[ows]\nThe one that fell a b_lock away from my office about a week ago was a\nsensational job for speed. They have that work here down cold now,and\neveryone hops to and does their special job whether it is digging, clearing,\nfire-fighting, and first-aid. Its very impressive. Everyone is tired out\n- ofcourse,but the end of it all is in sight, and it is most encourraglng.\nPistol Packing Patton has certainly redeemed himself with his li[g]htning\nadvance on the Continent has he not? Its been a sensational show The\nLiberation of Paris must have been amazing and I certainly wish I could\nhave wittnessed some of the scenes of jubilation. The flowers and wine b\nbeing showered upon the troops, and all the french dressed in their best\nto receive the advancing army.\nI expect to see Larry Lowman soon and it will be fun to\nhear all the home news.\nWith loads of love to you my darling.\nAlways-\nGertrude Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
