Colonel heard from Chhia Mei a few days ago, tellling him that you had been at Washington. If you did not stay very long at Richmond, you may have received my last letter at home. \n\n\tNow we have only five more days in camp. But these five more days will not be so nice as all the days we have enjoyed here in Plattsburg for to--morrow we are going to Maneovur[sic Maneuver]Camp whick gives the real soldier's life. Although it [2] will not be so nice, as I just said, it is really what we want.\n\n\tThis afternoon all medels [sic medals] were given to those who were qualified either in rifle or pistol and or both. I received two medels, [sic medals] one for rifle and one for pistol. The one for pistol costs me five dollars. You may wonder the reason why? Well, before we had pistol range, Sergeant and I had a bet. I told him that I would be able to get qualified in pistol range, if I would I would give him five dollars. On the other hand if I should fail, as I expected, in pistol range, he should give me five dollars. He accepted this bet. When coming to fire for record in pistol, I did not know the reason why I got qualified. So I had to give Sergeant five dollars and I did. It was for this reason that, as I said, my pistol medel [sic] \"costs me five dollars.\"\n\n\tAs soon as the camp is over I shall go to Meadville, Pennsylvania, to visit my German teacher Miss Schafheitlin. She wrote to  me, asking me to visit her and stay with her for a few days. But Mr. Li is expecting me at Columbus, Ohio, all the time, so I shall not be able to stay at Meadville more than two days.\n\n\tThe rest of my summer will be spent at Columbus with both Mr. Li and Mr. Wang. I will write to you as soon as I get there.\n\n\tThis afternoon on receiving a notice from Charleston Library Society, asking me to pay the arear [sic arrears] for my membership. I sent a money order. I hope I can be a full member when I come back to Charleston this fall.\n\n\tYours affectionately,\n\t\n\tFong Lee Wong\n\n[From:]Fong Lee Wong\nc/o Chinese Educational Mission\n2645 Conn. Ave., N.W.\nWashington, D.C.\n\n[Addressed:] Miss Laura M. Bragg\n38 Chalmers Street\nCharleston, S.C.\nValentine Museum\nRichmond, Va\n\n[Postmark:] Plattsburgh, N.Y. Military Br\nJul 18\n2 PM"
