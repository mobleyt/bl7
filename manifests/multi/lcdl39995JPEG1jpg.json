      "value": "Charleston Nov. 7th 1834 My dear wife, I got your letter last night and am quite relieved to hear that George Elliott is somewhat better for your Aunt Mathews had been making herself very miserable with the idea that his disease had terminated fatally. I can easily conceive your distress at the thought of Bowers forlorn situation, had it pleased God to take her husband from her. But I trust he will be spared and that you may thus be taught my dear Catherine a lesson of which however I trust you're not altogether ignorant that we must not too confidently anticipate pleasure, since your visit to Beaufort so long looked forward to with pleasing hopes had well nigh terminated in sorrow instead of joy. We still continue quite well, but Martha has fever still not constantly but frequently. She is very [MS ripped] & seems feeble and I am far from being easy as to [MS ripped] situation, the sudden and rapid decline of poor Mary makes me feel quite apprehensive as to the consequences of delicate health in a young person. She is not ready to return tomorrow with [MS damaged] Elliott, but desires to wait [MS damaged] for you [MS damaged] Emma [MS damaged] We were alarmed last Night with the crying of Fire in our Neighbourhood, and you will be sorry to hear that it was the house next to the one occupied by Mrs. Gadsden & the Thayers. It was so near that apprehensions were entertained lest their House would take fire. They [End Page 1] accordingly removed all of their furniture. Poor Mrs. Gadsden; you know her furniture is quite nice & handsome. The thought of removing it seemed almost to break her heart & I could not but think that good things were paid dearly for if the idea of losing them gave so much pain. I tried to persuade her & the rest of the ladies to go over to our House and keep their house quiet, but could not succeed until almost every thing was removed. By which time of course they were all very much exhausted, especially Mrs. Gadsden. At length however we prevailed upon Mrs. G., Mrs. Holmes and Miss Mary Thayer to go to our House, where Nancy got the Nursery read for them and where they slept last Night. But as Mrs. G. seemed very much exhausted and overcome, [MS torn] you Edward & myself began to think after they had retired to bed, that some catastrophe might occur before morning. Though all things passed off well enough and she seemed better this morning than might have been expected--As there our House was somewhat injured by the foolish anxiety of the Mob to save things locked up in closets [MS torn] is in great confusion all their blankets &c having [MS torn] soaked in protecting [MS torn] We have invited them to stay here tonight, which probably they will do. When of the cry of fire & the ringing of the Bell first reached my ear, I could not but feel thankfull [sic] to God that we had been kept thus far not only from the reality [End Page 2] but from the alarm of Fire. It is a dreadful thing & when I heard them crying \"where is Ma\" & \"where is Emma\" and \"where is Claudia,\" all of which arose only from needless fear, for there was not the least danger of life, I could not but shudder to think how I would feel, were my own House in flames & Rob or little Ted or yourself not to be found. It is easy to be a Hero and keep our nerves steady when another[']s House [MS torn] over their heads, but when it is our own I question whether the boldest do not act somewhat like cowards & the wisest like fools. I leave the rest to be finished tonight. Friday Afternoon--As I am going round to see Stephen whom I wish to take this letter [hole in MS] him--I have thought it best to finish it at once--[hole in MS] just got a letter from Dr. Tyng. He begs to affectionately remember to you. He has got into his Church and seems to consider his prospect encou[MS torn]. But I feel quite desponding as to the condition of Episcopal Church in Philadelphia since Dr. Bea[MS torn] death--However it is wrong to depend upon anyone--upon God & Him only should we trust. I think I mentioned in my last that our [MS ripped] confirmation [MS ripped] to think that most of the Candidates from the [MS ripped] had proper views of the [Rise?] and were [illegible]-minded. He certainly is faithful & I indeed hope that we shall enjoy a Blessing in Charleston yet. But my own weakness is felt daily with a more overwhelming weight. I feel an utter contempt for every thing I do & say. [End Page 3] I drank tea with Mrs. Trapman the other Evening. She begs to be remembered to you. Mrs. Moon & Mrs. Rose & the Misses Moon were there. I was pleased to find that spiritual conversation was neither deemed unfashionable or unpleasant. It is evident that Mrs. Moon & the elder daughter know what Spiritual Religion is. Miss Emma Moon seems serious, but is not converted. [In Margin] Mrs. W[raised letter]m H. Barnwell Beaufort So. Ca. I begin to count the days. Indeed I fear I am getting very lazy & indifferent to my duties here--though the last week I turned out & visited a good deal & I hope preached & taught Jesus from house to house, but my heart is so much in Beaufort & my visit--God may yet disappoint me--I pray not--May He bless you & the boys dear Catherine. My love to all & a kiss to Rob & Teddy. Yours truly W.H. Barnwell [End Page 4]"
