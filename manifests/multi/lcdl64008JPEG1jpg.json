      "value": "Charleston 19th Oct. 1814 My Dear Mother After expecting The Boat anxiously for several days, I was really glad to find on my return from visiting the last evening, that it had arrived, and with it a letter from my dear Mother. I am glad to hear that you all continue quite well, at this sickly season- and indeed sorry that Uncle is still so sick. I wish really that his Friends could persuade him to come to Charleston and try what the Physicians here can do for him. Mrs. S. Elliott is not yet confined, and I am told does not expect, until the next Month; but I dare say that will not make much difference to her, for you know Maria always attends to the house affairs, whether Mrs. Elliott is sick or well, and she has Isabel to nurse her. - it must indeed distress you to see Uncle suffer so much, for he has indeed been a true Friend to you in all your troubles, and difficulties, which you have experienced for several years past. and not only to you, but to all of us he has been a Father, when we had none of our own to be kind to us. I have not seen Uncle Wigg yet, it really distresses me to think that he has been here now a fortnight, and I have never seen him once,- the last time I heard of him, he was [End Page 1] still sick with the Fever, but better than he has been. its really unfortunate that he should be taken sick at this time.- but marching so far, and in such warm weather, was enough to kill one in such a wretched state of health as he is.- I suppose you sent your letter by George to Dr. Finley, that you wrote me about- I think he was the best person you could possibly have sent it to, for he appears to me to be as anxious about every body's affairs here as he used to be in Beaufort. I have not seen cousin Finley since I wrote you last though I have called there twice.- I am told that Capt Hutson is at Haddrels point. Mr. Heyward has returned from the country and I am in hopes will not have the Fever, which I was very apprehensive he would have had but as a substitute has a violent cough, which has plagued him very much.- I am quite well, better I think, than I have been this Summer. and look forward with a great deal of pleasure to the tenth of the next Month as Mr. Heyward has promised if possible, to bring me to Beaufort about that time, I don't know how I shall make out to ride so far, for if I minded the long ride so much coming to Town, what will I say to it now. I have as you requested dear Mother, been looking about for the Curtain Calico, and have met with some that I like very much and hope that [End Page 2] you will do the same. I gave 50c for it, which was the lowest price, and it appears to be very good and strong I found that it was not quite 3/4 wide, therefore told the shopkeeper to cut off 13 1/2 yds and he cut off but 13 yds and said that he did not hear me.- however rather than lose it I thought that I had better take it, and if you find that it will not do, I can get as much more as you send for. but I really hope it will do I have sent the comb for Elizabeth at $3, but have not been able to get the hand bell that you wrote for- The Velvet that I saw this evening was 25c a yard, and I thought that I had better wait and look again, do write me if you will give that price, and whether I shall inquire again for the Bell. do give my love to Brother E [and] Sister [page torn] and all my Friends. Tell E that I will [page torn] to her very soon.- kiss all the children for me and give my love to Nancy and Sally. has Charlotte forgotten sister Hetty yet? - believe me dear Mother To be your ever affection. Daughter Hetty Heyward [End Page 3] Mrs. Mary Barnwell Beaufort by George.-- [End Page 4]"
