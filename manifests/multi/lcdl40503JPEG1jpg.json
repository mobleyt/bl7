      "value": "POLLY SOUTHERN 5021 HARSHMANVILLE ROAD DAYTON, OHIO 45424 Sept. 1, 1965 Dear Vida, I have meant to write you ever since I got these pictures back from my trip to Europe last November, as I felt sure you’d like to see the “ancient church” at Lusk where the monument to Sir Christopher Barnewall is located. The inside ones didn’t come out at all, sad to say, as I didn’t have a flash attachment and the walls were so thick that not enough light came through the small windows. The tomb is under the tower and is open to the sky, so that it was covered with twigs, trash, bird droppings, etc., I was sorry to see (the church hasn’t been used for some years, as it is “Church of Ireland” and only Catholics live in the area, except for one family). Some repair work was being done on the roof, and I learned at the tourist bureau in Dublin that it is hoped that many of these historic landmarks will someday be restored so that visitors can enjoy them. When I found Lusk on the map before I went to Ireland, I determined to go there, and the first day I was in Dublin I inquired about busses (it is about an hour’s drive northeast, up the coast). Found that I could take one about 2 p.m Sunday afternoon from the center of town. While I was waiting at the stop, I talked to two nice women, and when I told them where I was going, one said, “I’m going to Lusk to visit a friend who lives just beyond the old church, so I’ll show you where it is. So we walked past it, but there was nothing in the cemetery that looked like the monument. So we walked on to her friends’ cottage ( the [Frank?] ]Dennis’?]--very plain people, but friendly and interested--he raises tomatoes in a greenhouse next to the house) and the wife went with me to another cottage to get the key to the church. The man who lived there went with us and opened it. To my great disappointment, there was no sign of the tomb in the church itself, but then we found a door leading to the tower, and there it was. The faces are worn almost smooth (maybe it was out of doors at one time) but the detail of the clothing is quite clear. It looks like gray stone, but is supposedly marble. He has a ruff collar (Elizabethan) and embroidered sleeves, sword, etc. She has a high collar and the dress falls in folds from high under the arms to her toes. The carving around the sides is hard to read (because of the odd printing) but is just as stated in the history you sent. (page 18). One thing that has made me curious is the reason why the Minister Eire looked all the facts up--Is he, [too?], a[End Page 1] 2. member of the family? I can’t imagine going to all that trouble it he weren’t! Anyway, there was also another tomb in the same room, flush with the floor, which bore a figure of a knight in chain mail lying recumbent with his sword beside him, and according to data in some books I saw at the tourist bureau (see enclosed) it is the only one of its period still in existence. After we had seen the church sufficiently and relocked it, Mrs. Dennis said, “Will ye come for tea?” and of course I accepted with enthusiasm. I had a delightful hour and a half, hearing all about their lives, Kennedy’s visit (which all of Ireland cherishes), etc., and eating delicious bread-and-butter, cake with raisins (something they make for Halloween, which had been the night before), and tea. Frank Dennis “walked me” down to the bus stop, and when we learned that the schedule had changed and we’d have another half hour to wait, he took me in the town pub across the street (newly remodeled, with inside plumbing and carpeting on the floor!) * It was fun, and I’m anxious to go back some time and spend longer. They told me that some of the descendants still live in a house on the original site (20 miles away) of Turvey (the manor house) and it would be interesting to meet them, though I think the name is not Barnwell any longer. It was quite a pilgrimage. What finally got me to the point of actually writing after all these months is the fact that I’m engaged to be married again, and I wanted you all to know. He’s “Ted” (Frederic John) Dunne, and has worked in the same office with me for about 2 years. His wife, who had been a victim of Parkinson’s disease for many years, died in May of a stroke, quite suddenly, and although he is 10 years older than I am, we found that we have so many interests in common and enjoy being together so much--plus the fact that he loves me more than I ever thought possible and wants to \"look after me\" for the rest of our lives that I have grown to love him completely and want to be with him always. We drove down to Highlands week before last so that he could meet Mother and Daddy, and although she was a little skeptical beforehand, she completely capitulated when he put his arms around her and hugged her and told her how he felt about me. He has grown children (a son, 34, in Erie, Pa., and a daughter, 22 here) and 5 grandchildren. We’re going to be married here on Thanksgiving afternoon, and James and Charles, at least, and hopefully Ruth and Anne Lister, will come, though it is doubtful that Mother and Daddy can come. We had hoped to be married in Atlanta, but it began to get complicated so far as the church was concerned, since I am divorced, and John Ball started throwing obstacles in the way (although Milton Richardson, who is now Bishop of Houston told me in Highlands that he thought there would be no problems.) Still, it would have been awfully difficult to arrange it at such a long distance, so we’ll be married here and then go to Atlanta for a week at Christmas. [He?] has lovely white hair, and a wonderful sense of humor. He “fell in love” with “my” N. C. mountains, and is determined to move there in the next few years to live. (We went to Flat Rock and saw the *for an ale.[End Page 2] 3. church and paid “Aunt Sara” Davis a short visit, then to Kanuga, Bonclarken, Hendersonville, and on to Highlands. Ted wants to visit all the places I enjoyed as I was growing up, and I surely hope we can visit Charleston one of these days. I was so sorry my friends, Mary and Bob Blitch, [I?] [didn’t?] get to meet you last fall. They have just moved to Washington, where he has gone with NASA (he resigned from the Air Force, after 10 years--is a West Point graduate, but just got “fed up,”) but will come back for the wedding, as I want her to be my attendant, since she has been my closest friend for the past 3 years. I went to Atlanta for a week when Mother and Daddy had their Golden Wedding anniversary, and it was grand seeing all the family connections after such a long time (there were 35 altogether, including Aunt Margaret Ravenel, who flew over as a surprise from Columbia). Mother hasn’t been feeling very well since then, although she felt pretty well in the mountains. I only hope she can “snap out of it” as she has done before when she has had these “nervous spells.” She gives me news of you every so often, and I only wish we were in closer touch, but was delighted to hear that Vida had a new baby. I don’t even have her address, but I’d like to at least acknowledge and congratulate her. If you can spare the time, do write me and bring me up to date on things. Give my love to Fitz and Catherine, too--is she at home? Devotedly, Polly[End Page 3] Photo 1 Photo 2 Photo 3"
