      "value": "Washington, D.C.\nSept. 16, 1929\n\nMy dear Miss Bragg:\n\n\tAbout three weeks ago, I had the pleasure of receiving your letter when I was in Columbus, Ohio. I was very sorry to learn that you had been sick and at the same time I could not help feeling greatly thankful that you first wrote to me after your sickness. Had I not busily engaged in translating a small English military book into Chinese and waited for the coming of new Chinese students so that I would be to tell you when I would be home with new students, as you had asked me, I would have answered long ago. For this reason I hope you would excuse me for my delay.\n\n\tNow regarding the new students, I am very sorry to say that none of them will come to the Citadel, but all have [2] changed their mind and gone to other schools. So I will come home with myself.\n\n\tI met my friend at Chicago on the fourteenth. Mr. Li was also there and insisted in detaining her one day in order to have a rest. But one day in Chicago made her more ]. feel tired in--stead of refreshed [sic]. And as she had to get everything arranged as early as possible in Washington and as the re-opening of the Citadel drew near, so she and I left Chicago yesterday by 12:30 train and arrived here in Washington at 8:05 in the morning. She is still in a tired condition and I am not quite different. But I can not delay and I do ot like to delay any longer to write to you. So inspite [sic] of the poor work of my brain, I am writing to you, hoping you will forgive me for my poor and illegible hand writing \n\n\t[3] One of my boy friends, who came this summer, had bought Chinese cups and the four books of English translation. But he had broken the cups when he reached Tokio [alternative spelling for Tokyo], Japan on his voyage to the United States. So I am very sorry that I shall be able to present to you only the four--books. My friend has brought a light shade for you and I will bring it home.\n\n\tWhen I wrote my last two letters I thought Chia--Mei had already gone to Taxas [sic Texas]. This was also what Mrs. House thought as I found from her letter to me. Now I think he must be in the aviation school, Taxas[sic].\n\n\tI will be home on the twenty-first, but at what time I am now unable to tell you. I am feeling very glad as I shall see you pretty soon.\n\n\tAffectionately yours\n\t\n\tLittle Captain\n\n[From:]F.L. Wong\nc/o Chinese Educational Mission\n2645 Connecticut Ave.\nWashington, D.C.\n\n[Addressed:] Miss Laura M. Bragg\n38 Chalmers Street\nCharleston, S.C."
