      "value": "Dear Gertie, \nI suppose you are back from the plantation by now and\nfull of news of the old nlace and the troubles or beauties that\nimpressed you there. I am so interested to hear and hope you will\ngive me the low down before you forget your first impression and\nonly remember the nice things that happened.\nIt is such a lovely and suny day here. Spring is in the\nair if such a thing is possible in a place where the temperature rarely\ngoes below seventy. Nevertheless something must be in the air because\nI am yawning and stretching and wishing there was I window that I could\ne look out of at the green trees. However I think we will be going up\nto our new building in about three weeks and then we will have the\nmost lovely view of pearl harbor and the sea beyond. It will be very\nnice to leave the dust and noise of the navy yard behind and get up\non the hill where the admirals live and there is nothing to do but\nsleep and enjoy onesself the whole day through.\nThe outrigger club has fallen into disr[epute] with Morris :nd\nI. For some reason the meals have become very cold and the food terrible.\nWhat is it that makes a place go up an  down I wonder. For a while it\nwas so crowded that it was almost impossible to get a table without knowing\nthe manager and giving him a new set of tires whenver you went. Now\nthe place is almost deserted and there is no one playing volley ball\nor lying in the su . I suppose withih a few weeks it will all come back\nand be as croided as ever, and that the only trouble is that people are\nfickle and have decided that it is no longer the place to go. If they\nwould only serve hot food again I would be delighted and would not care\nwhether an one ever came again .\nToday I have been checking over all the movie film that\nis sent to us for the purpose of learning how to identify ships and\nplanes. It is wonderful how things are shipped that you do not wish\nand you can write and send cables without ever seeing the things that\nyou need very badly . That however isthe way with everything whether\nhyou are in the Na vy or not so it does not matter a great deal.\nI am enclosing some picutres that mean nothing as far as\nI can see, but as you asked for picutres here they are. I still have\nnot been able to take a picutre of Morris and he of course cannot take\none of me, but we are still trying.\nWith all my love. I told Smells to continue sending flowers\nto you but did not send him the cards in time to enclose them so if\nyou get any flowers without cards you may know it is from me.\nSidney"
