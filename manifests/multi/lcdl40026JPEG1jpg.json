      "value": "South Carolina College April 21. 1843. My Dear Brother I owe you an apology for having suffered your truly fraternal and edifying letter to be so long unanswered. But my afflictions and engagements have both been such as to prevent me from attending to the claims of my friends. Every white member of my family has been sick and some of them have been sick even nigh unto death. But through the goodness of God all are quite restored. I myself have been suffering severely from a cold and still have a distressing cough and considerable irritation in the bronchia. My wasting strength reminds me that my time is likely to be short and that, consequently, whatever I purpose to do for my blessed Master and His glorious cause should be done quickly. A sense of my past unfaithfulness-- an abiding conviction that I have been a worthless sluggard in the vineyard of the Lord presses me to the earth. I have done nothing worthy of my age, my opportunities, or myself. The past is a mournful blank, and nothing but the atoning blood of the Divine Redeemer [illegible: hole in page. nothing?] but the promises of His grace and the sweet consolations of His Spirit sustain my mind under the intolerable burden of my own worthlessness. The Scriptures daily become more precious to me. I can enter now more fully than I could ever do before [with?] the depths of their promises and my mind has learned to [repose?] [illegible: hole in page. on?] their testimony with stability. [End Page 1] and peace. I need not say that I entered most heartily into your leading views of the great and sublime doctrine of gratuitous justification. The experimental point of views in which you have chosen to present it has its advantages and I am not sure but that it is a better method for a popular discourse than a more systematic imposition. There is one point in which, if I understand you, I cannot go along with you. I do not believe that moral distinctions are arbitrary. It seems to me that they grow out of the perfections of the Deity and are as unchanging as His Own nature. Perhaps, however, in supposing that you have sanctioned a different doctrine I have misapprehended your meaning. Let me beg you, my brother, to go on and bring out distinctly and clearly in their experimental bearings, as [illegible: pential?] elements of the health, prosperity & growth of God's children, all the doctrines of grace. Whether men will hear or whether they will forbear it is our business to proclaim the truth-- and we may rest assured that our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. This is an age of itching ears-- an age in which charity is cherished for every thing but the truth of heaven. They consequently, who resolve to be [illegible: hole in page. faithful?] must expect to endure persecution. The Lord, however, will stand by all those servants who stand by His word. I was engaged in preparing a work on the atonement when I was arrested in the immediate prosecution of my labours (to which I could devote only intervals of time) by [End Page 2] [illegible: page torn] of letters in the United States Catholic Miscellany which I felt bound to notice. It appeared to me to be a call of God to expose in open day the hidden abominations of a wicked and pestilent superstition. The writer has been fairly delivered into my hands and I think that I am solemnly bound to have him in pieces in Gilgal. It is my fervent prayer that the whole controversy may be over-ruled to God's glory. I have earnestly sought Divine direction in the latter and can safely say that I never engaged in any enterprise with a fuller conviction that the Lord was with me. I regret that my antagonist is an old schoolmate for whom I cherish the most Kindly feelings. He is the subject of my prayers and I hope that he may be of yours. The occasions [illegible: hole in page] with which I treat him is intended to expose his [illegible: page torn. incompetency?] and thus indirectly destroy his influence for [illegible: page torn] Such a controversy is greatly needed among us. Popery is advancing secretly, stealthily, imperceptibly like a panther on its prey. Our people need to be roused. Thousands seemed to have settled down into the conviction that the thing has changed its character as though an infallible body could [illegible: hole in page] I am persuaded, however, that the old Scotch and Huguenot blood of this State is not dead, it is only sleeping and I have reason to believe that my letters already have done some good. It is unfortunate that I have so little time to devote to them. They have all been written in haste and mostly in hours stolen from the urgent demands of nature. [End Page 3] I have been afraid that your brother is offended with [illegible: page torn] has never noticed my last letter. What ground of offence [illegible: page torn. I?] have given I cannot imagine unless I spoke too freely of the Apostolic Succession. I should regret exceedingly to [illegible: alienate?] his feelings, for I love him even as I love my own soul. Very truly. J.H. Thornwell. [written on side of page:] The Rev J.H. Thornwell April 21st .1843-- And May 3rd 1843-- To the Reverend William H. Barnwell Charleston S.C.
