      "value": "Columbia January 2nd 1860 Dear Brother I have at last seen Mr Green he is to have the leases all fixed tomorrow. I have mentioned the fact to all but Shields, I have also by Ellens consent rented the barbershop for $200 to a Jew for a clothing store. I consider this the highest rent of all. If you had let me rent out the whole of the stores I would have made them pay $250.250. & 200 =700 Stables 300 =1000 which would be fifty dollars more than the interest on amt due but it is now too late, and the fifty is on the other side. I have seen Nichols & Huggins they both very readily agreed to reduce their risk to 1 pr cent and filled out a notice which I enclose, I mentioned to the upholster what you said about the door and the previous rent, to ? to 1st Jany. he says \"he thinks it is the best way, and is all right\" I do not remember anything further that you asked[End Page 1] me to do, we have had very severe weather since you left, it is quite clear today but cold, Ellen has got through with her four ton of coal, I had to buy her 1/2 a ton at ($14)=7.00, Saturday, she has written to Baker for six tons, I hope he will send it at once, wonder will he let them have it at the same price ($?1/4) that he did in the summer. If it will be cheaper freight, he had better send a car load (7 tons) instead of sending it in hogsheads as he did last winter and as I think Ellen has now ordered it, if not too late please see, and order accordingly, I heard from home yesterday father has been sick, from constipation of the bowels, but is about again, and I hope by this time, all night, Ellen and all at the convent just as you left them. Eliza and the children well, all join in love to yourself, Louisa, Francis and family. Pray for you affectionate brother John[End Page 2] I have been thinking that I did wrong in mentioning to you anything about the content of the letter you brought to me, or the one I sent by you, I hope it did now compromise you in the least officially, if so please let me know that, I may guard against a similar act. J.L. Ellen still complains very much of Mr Palmers work, I will have to let her fight it out with him[End Page 3] John Lynch Columbia SC scratch math[End Page 4]"
