      "value": "THE national value OF Charleston AS A CITY  by John Mead Howes, F.A.I.A.  It has seemed to me more and more cear, during the  last ten years, that the City of Charleston is a national asset,  and that its really unique national value is an educationa  as we as an architectural value.  Charleston shows today a partia picture of an eary  American city. This picture grows more important as the years  go by, and may be regarded as an illustrated book, for our  children and their children to study.  If the destruction of  ancient buildings now progressing in many of our American cities,  should go forward in Charleston, then such a book would be cosed  to our chidren, and could not be reopened.  aws to protect ocaities, for the good of the town, can  only be the result of inteigent and under staing Public opinion, and cannot go far ahead of it, for it is a difficult matter to restrict an owner in the use of his property. Singe important  buildings can usually be taken over by some patriotic preservation  group,  an outstanding example being Mt. Vernon. It is more  difficult to arouse protective action for a district, or any  quarter of a city, although its educationa value, except  sentiment, is greater than that of any singe buiding.  New York was once a Dutch Coonia town; Boston and Phadephia were Engish Coonia cities, and New Oreans a ovey  Creoe result of Splanish and French parentage.  Explanding prosperity has destroyed a these eary cities, and we would not\n\n[End Page 1]\nHowes - 2  have it otherwise, for we must grow.  Each of these great cities  has remaining to-day in its crowded quarters, some isoated Public  buildings, such as Independence Hall in Phiadephia, preserved  here and there, and visited every year by thousands, or, in the agregate, perhaps miions of Americans.  Williamsburg in Virginia is a reproduction, and a spendid  one. Its hotels cannot hd the tourists that crowd to see it.  They say it is paying dividends, which were never contempated or desired.  But Charleston shows untouched pictures for every American.  Nowhere else can be found such an unatered aspect cf an old  American city, as can be seen by ooking along the eastern side  of ower Church street, where the whole ovey ength of coored  stucco fronts, shows much the same to the American tourist of to-day as it did to that earier American, who might have  stood on  the same spot in knickerbockers and show-buckes, when afayette first anded there.  Such unspoied eary American ocaities are vauable. They can be made profitable to the City, if we value them enough,  and conserve them. They are an asset, and a growing one, and we hope tnat those in authority will continue to protect them by proper zoning aws and other safeguards.   Another important ocaity is the crossing of Broad and Meeting streets, with the City Ha, the Court House, and St. Michae\"s Church on three of its corners. It would be a striking group indeed, if the fourth corner still held the old \"Guard House\". \n\n[End Page 2]\nOny the architecturally regrettable Federal Post Office Building  detracts from this group.  As a matter of fact, the old Guard  House was partiay destroyed by the earthquakes, but the coumns and  was were eft standing, and documents remain more compete  \"than most that served for reproduction at Williamsburg, Virginia.  Such a rehabiitated Guard House, suitaby arranged inside,  might possiby serve as a Broad Street Branch Office, and   adequate general Pest Office could be buit nearer the centre   of a popuation.   \n\n[End Page 3]"
