      "value": "Ursuline Convent & Academy Columbia S.C. Dec. 9th 1863 Dear Brother, I've given you the dark side of the picture, but today I give you the other & bright side. You know \"after a storm there's always a calm\"-- I believe Socrates told Xanthippe. When she passionately dashed the tub of water over him. After a storm there's always a shower. Which sentence is often repeated to passionate women when the tears begin to flow. But you know I'm not one of the \"melting mood characters. Your heart would have rejoiced yesterday - The feast of the Imm. Con - to see so many communicants among our pupils & such happy faces. It was quite a day of devotion. At 12 O'clock we had the noveau for peace. Vespers in choir at 3 PM. At 3 1/2 Benediction. B.S. followed immediately by our usual Procession on that festival--the order of which was very respectably observed by all. The statue & [In Right Hand Margin in Long Hand] another highly gifted girl & would be very useful. She was Victor's confidant & it was amusing to see Anna's face as she watched continuance to leave the result of V--'s interview with me.[End Page 1] and banners were carried by the children who all seem quite impressed by the ceremony. At the conclusion we received some children into the first grade of the \"children of Mary\" & gave an appropriate instruction on the object & nature of procession in honor of our Blessed Mother which gratified & instructed both Protestants & Catholics. Our friend Mrs. Horlbeck found her way in with her little daughter, & seemed perfectly absorbed by all that she saw & heard. She must have a leaning towards Catholicism. We have received another new Boarder--quite a character & very clever. Her Mother Mrs. Keeley, & herself, are both studying to become Catholics. & I have just answered an application from Capt. Elliott of Pocotaligo & from J.E. Robins (?) Esq. of Blackville, S.C. & engaged to receive at Jan 1st a Miss Mamie (?), wife of Mr. John Caldwell of the R.R. Presidency these together with Miss [illegible], will fill up all our vacancies left by the departure of Misses Scule, Woodruff, +c And what do you think--![End Page 2] We have a new application--a postulant for our novitiate, to fill the vacancy left by Miss Jones-- Oh! I believe I have not told you that she left on Monday morning bright & early under the protection of young Blanchard the Genrl's son. I congratulate myself on the nice way I fixed for her departure--she having on Sunday received a letter from Fr. Gache, who decides with me but expresses what I would not, that her vocation is not for any religious order, but if her infirmity will permit, is for the married life. I thought the sooner the better she was out of this house, where she received every thing thro' a distorted medium & so amiably got her off at once, much to my relief. She expresses to my fair great affection & gratitude. I think she & Stella Clarke very much alike in general character. Madame Ellen has the advantage--education & training. But who do you think proposed herself to me[End Page 3] --no other than Victoria Blanchard. What do you think of our receiving her? Her mother opposes the step as an ungrateful one to her, & says she is too fond of admiration even to be a nun. Her Father rejoices at the idea, & I have no doubt it is partly owing to his counsel that she offers herself, although she says not. It is true she often said when our pupil, that she feared she could never save her soul in the world +c. But I attached no importance to it--thinking her so thoroughly worldly. Sister Charles, her confidante says however, that she is not surprised. Do you remember the affair of Col Schaller? Of course that had died out entirely, & since then she has had another suitor, but she will not accept him. And will if her Mother concurs with her Father, wish to enter our novitiate at some not very distant day. In the mean time we will engage her to give singing lessons to some of our pupils. I would be delighted if she really had a true vocation for she is one of our best educated pupils in French, English, music, Algebra +c +c & has a very fine constitution--so you see she is much superior to Miss Jones, who seems to fancy that the house should fall when she left. I will expect Anna Lowe to be our next offer. She is[End Page 4]"
