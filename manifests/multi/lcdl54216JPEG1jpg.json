We are expecting every day to move, either to South Island or to Cat Island or to some other Island, but when we\n[End Page 1]\ndo moove [move] I want you to come and stay with me about a Month. I will fix up a little Bedstead and Bed for you and John Tolar, and you can have good times, there are a heap of little Boys in George Town that call themselves Brooks Guard Boys. I want you down here to help them form a company of Boys to Drill. Would it not be nice to have about 20 Boys all in Uniform to turn out in the Evening at Dress Parade? John Tolar is going to Town in the morning to have his Uniform Cut out. I will save cloth enough to make yours, and young Shackleford Hennings' Mother will have it made up for you after it is Cut out. you must write\n[End Page 2]\nto me and let me know whether you want to come or not, and then you must be smart and please your Mother so that she will be willing for you to come. I must stop now as I want to write to your Sisters Good night my Boy Your Father John R Beaty\n[End Page 3]"
