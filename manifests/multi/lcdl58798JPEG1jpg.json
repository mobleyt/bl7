This was revealed yesterday by  the Commerce and Industry  Association of New York, which conducted the survey as the basis for  recommendations to the City Council here. The cities covered in the  survey were Chicago, Phiadephia,  Boston, Detroit, Ceveand, Kansas  City, Pittsburgh, San Francisco,  os Angees, Buffao, Rochester,  Houston, Newark, Atanta, Memphis, Providence, New Oreans,  Seatte, Indianapois. St. Pau, San  Antonio, Minneapois, Toedo and  Oakand. .  San Francisco has constructed;  a 1,700-car parking- garage, four.  stories in depth, beneath a city  park in the business area. It is  privately operated.

Five cities had tried  a limited number of overhead pedestrian crosswaks with varying  success.  Fifteen of the cities prohibit  curbstone parking entirey in their  main business sections, and limit it  to one ide of the street in less  congested areas.
