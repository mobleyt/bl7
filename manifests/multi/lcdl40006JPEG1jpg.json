      "value": "Baltimore 6th Sept 1839 Dear Madam I received your kind letter of June 28th on the 3rd July, and would have replied to it before but that since then I have been a great deal absent from home I trust, however, that I have not delayed so long as to incur the charge of ingratitude which I should most justly merit did I further neglect to return you my acknowledgements. Mr Barnwell's sermon was truly acceptable & I rejoice that the colored man has such a friend. I hope I have not taken too great a liberty in making it public thro' the pages of the Maryland Colonization Journal. If so, I will be content to bear the blame for the good which is likely to follow. The \"Md Col. Journal\" was chosen because it is read by many of our slave owners and because I would impress them as well as others that every scheme for the benefit of the black should be subordinate to his religious education. The catechisms are well arranged and I am sure will prove useful auxiliaries in my work. At present, I have in use but one of those published under the direction of the Bishop which my wife finds very serviceable. I deeply lament that I am doing so little for the black population, but humbly hope that God will be pleased to make me more useful hereafter. Before a great while I expect to remove to the western part of this state, where altho for some time I must be engaged[End Page 1] in Missionary duty, yet I shall always include the colored people in my labors. I have remained thus long in Balt. simply on account of the necessities of the two congregations with which I have been connected. I cannot expect the privilege of visiting Charleston this winter duties are so numerous & so pressing that I dare not undertake such a journey simply with a view to my own profit & gratifications yet will yourself & sister be often though of with pleasure & regret -- pleasure that I have made your acquaintance, and regret that i cannot to a greater extent avail myself of its advantages. I take the liberty of sending you in the \"Methodist Protestant & Family Visitor\" a sermon I finished for publication -- it is but due to myself to remark that I was induced to make it public that I might procure several copies for some friends to whom I considered it peculiarly applicable & who were not present when it was preached -- in fact, it was for their benefit rather than with the hope of general good that it was delivered. Your letter came to hand on the evening of the 3d July & on the 4th I left home for an absence of nearly two weeks taking Mrs P. with me -- previous to my departure I enquired at several of our principal Hotels for Miss Tucker, but without success, nor have I since had the pleasure of seeing her. The Bearer of your letter did not remain a moment after placing [End Page 2] it in the hand of the servant, so that I had no clue to her residence. Tho' I presume that ere this, she has returned south, I feel obliged for the opportunity afforded me of becoming acquainted with her, and hope that it may be available at some future day. I notice the death of Bishop Bowen, & while I lament your loss, pray that you may be blest in securing a worthy successor. I would that we had Mr Elliott of Mr Barnwell over us! Mrs P sends her love to Mrs Heriot & yourself, in which I desire heartily to join, and hoping to have the pleasure of again hearing from you, remain with great regard yours J. Peterkin [End Page 3] Mrs M. E. Ramsay care of Rev W. H. Barnwell Charleston South Carolina [End Page 4]"
