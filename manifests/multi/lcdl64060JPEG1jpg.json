      "value": "Combahee Jan. 5 1837 My dear gSon Your letter dated Cambridge Dec. 17-Post marked Dec 22, has just reached me. By which you make an earnest appeal to the parental chest. This is not in vain-I have directed Ladson [and] Co to remit directly to you Two hundred and fifty dollars, which will be an addition to the quarterly remittance. This is the 1st information I have had of the loss of your post manteau and clothes. I wish it had been known earlier. I am alone at Combahee, at this time-my Son Arthur and his family are in Chrl.ton for a few days-Nat attempts to stay with me: but his friendly visits to Beaufort and St. Lukes are so frequent, that he sinks the Companion. and has a languishing eye upon White hall. Not big White Hall, but the little one over the creek. The old house is pulled down, and the materials for a new one provided, this gives me much embarrassment. The work on the house, is upon too large a scale for White hall. While it is altogether doubtfull, if the house will be used-and who may be the owner. I am desirous [End Page 1] of an early surrender of my Administration, and only wait to see the Minority closed- I found myself obliged to put my veto upon an agreement, which Nat had made in Beaufort with Zealy the carpenter, to frame and raise the house-This is now stopped, but the difficulties and expenses are not over. Nat is in Beaufort, and is expected to-day, with his friend Cuthbert, for amusement, and to see the nakedness of the land. Our corn houses and provisions are full, but our rice crops are small. The excitement for the West is ruining So. Ca. The negroes as well as the white population are moving off in great numbers. The living for first settlers is course; but the profits are immense, and the temptation overpowering. Even Nat talks of Alabama, sometimes of settling in Texas-He appears not to know his own mind from one day. Hetty is at Mrs. T. Smiths- Ashepoo. and is sound-wind and limb-I expect to see her shortly at Combahee with Maria.-Perhaps after the wedding of Miss Blake is over, in this neighborhood-On the first Thursday in Febry next Miss Fanny Blake is to change [End Page 2] her name and title, and is to be called Mrs. Thomas Rutledge. The fortune is on the side of the Lady- The Gentleman has nothing but his fair family name, good manners, and very intellectual. The match is very favorably for Fanny. My Son Chd. returned from Beaufort yesterday and has left his two eldest children there, at school- I am Your's Affect.ly Nath. Heyward [End Page 3] Blue House 3 Febry Mr. James B. Heyward Cambridge Mass. [End Page 4]"
