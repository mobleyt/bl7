      "value": "GEORGE W. SIMONS, JR.  MEM. AM. S0C. C. E.  MEM. AM. INST. OF planNERS  municipal ENGINEERING  RESEARCH AND planning  HIDEBRANDT Building  Jacksonville, FORIDA [2]  January 17, 1944.  Mr. Robert N. S. Whitelaw, Director,  Carolina Art Associaltion,  Gibbes Art  Gallery,  Charleston, 5, South Carolina.  Dear Mr. Whitelaw:  I was peased to earn from your letter of the 15th that some progress  is being made and that you anticipate further developments. In my opinion  you are absoutey correct in thinking that the whole program should revove  around a mutua interest in Charlestons history. Charlestons historical  background is a priceess asset which from a productive standpoint is the  equivaent of a llarge producing industry. It is something you have whereas  an industry is something you must go out and get. However in any regional  planning program the two must be coordinated in an acceptable pattern of  development.  As I  tried to emphasize in my report the planning job must be broad in  scope, enisting the cooperative interest of many groups. .And I fee that  this breadth of cooperative effort can be advanced better thru the sponsorship of the Carolina Art  Association than thru the limited - and more or less  circumscribed interests - of the Chamber of Commerce. It must be remembered  that the Chamber is primarily a trade and commercial body.  The magnitude and extent of the job may look frightening but it can be  developed graduay according to the progress of work. A  fu time secretary  would however stimuate and guide it effectivey. Mr. Wedon is located with  the Tennessee planning Commission at 215 Paza Buiding, Knoxvie. He has  been there since leaving the Charleston area and his work there has better  equipped him to step into another position. I regard Mr. Wedon highy. He  is a fine character and a feow of good personaity. During his work in  Charleston for the national Resources planning Board he made a ot of friends  and so far as I was able to earn made a good impression. He used to contact  Mr. place frequently and used Mr. McDonad\"s office in the Chamber of Commerce  as his headquarters. Since leaving Charleston he has tod me he would ike  to get back there. Mrs. Wedon is a former Forence, South Carolina, gir.  Atho I do not know what saary he is now getting, I believe you might get  him for $300 to $400 per month. When I heard from him last he was a itte  worried over his draft status but possiby that is setted by now.  Wedon \n\n[End Page 1]\n-2-  could do a good job. Using Wedon on a fu time basis and etting me  define and guide the program in a Consultant capacity I fee that we  could accompish what my report indicated should be done. And too I  believe we could utiize the Chamber of Commerce to advantage. Mr.  Wedon\"s name is Harod C.  When you are ready for me, et me know and I will come.  with kindest regards, I am,  Sincerely yours,  George W. Simons  GWS:EBB   \n\n[End Page 2]"
