      "value": "Savannah August 28th 1839 Revd & dear Sir I received your truly Christian letter of the 19th inst on the 21st in which I wd have immediately replied had not some pressing engagements prevented me from doing so. But in answering it now need I state that it was a source of consolation to me under my present painful struggles. When I reflect that the abandonment of that system to which I have been hitherto attached may render me a profane object of abhorrence to those whom I have heretofore esteemed by many of whom I have been tenderly loved -- that unjust suspicions [illegible] may be indulged in against me without pity -- that perhaps there will not be one amongst my former friends generous enough to stem the torrent of obloquy that may be hurled against me & to assert my sincerity. When I say I reflect on all these distressful circumstances consequent upon my quitting the pale of that church, which claims for herself alone the Divine attribute of infallibility, & excludes all other denominations from all claims to salvation, it is small consolation to me to think that there will be one, at least, in whose tender bosom I may expect to find a spark of that sympathy so congenial to the spirit of the Gospel of J.C. You may perhaps imagine, in your present state of resignation & contentment, that these reflections should have no weight with me in so important a matter as that which I have now in contemplation. Dear sir there was a time when, like you, I glowed in my religion, & when I thought that none could be saved but those who professed it, and it is probable that [I'd?] have thought so still had not some internal voice whispered to me the justice of examining with impartiality every argument for & against. In your letter to me you state that you have had apprehensions lest I might relapse back into a state of [illegible] with known abuses & errors, rather than own the risk of encountering others greater [illegible] by a change. Dear sir I am not one of those who when they take up a subject of inquiry lay it aside hastily without sufficiently investigating it. It is true, a long lapse of time has intervened since first I made known my doubts to you. But if you take into consideration the many obstacles that have presented themselves to my[End Page 1] decided abandonment of a system which I imbibed on the breast of my mother, & which, you justly remark \"grew with my growth & strengthened with my strength\", you will not at all be surprised at my not once coming to a hasty decission (sic). You state also in your letter that you inquired into my character. I am grateful to you for doing so. But I am more grateful still for your apprising me that you found it to be unblemished. I am far indeed from boasting of an exemption from the usual frailties of man. But among the weaknesses to which I plead guilty, there is none, I believe, who know me, that will accuse me of anything that is mean, dishonorable, or immoral. You likewise tell me that you do not seriously think that I can, in my present Ecclesiastical connection, enjoy any peace or quietness of conscience, & that, therefore, my obvious duty is to protest against it. Rev. Sir, I have not enjoyed either for some time past, but by the reception of your letter much of my disquietude & uneasiness has been dispelled. My resolution is now formed of becoming a member of your church on the 15 of March next, which will be the Anniversary of my nativity. On that day, with the assistance and grace of Almighty God I will make my profession in your Church & in your presence regardless of the denunciation & excommunication that may be thundered against me. Until then, be assured, that no error shall be taught by my like. I have not done so, if I recollect distinctly, since the first doubt arose in my mind, making it always a point to avoid polemical hopes, & to select such moral themes as any minister might expatiate on without any allusion to the points of difference between himself & his separate brethren. And this line of conduct I shall adhere to until the anxiously expected day arrives, when I shall have the heartfelt pleasure of uniting me efforts with you in teaching the same faith and the same doctrine. Please to write soon to me & to inform me of the necessary steps to be taken by me previous to my profession. By doing so you will add a favor to those already conferred on one whose fervent prayer is that the God of all glory and sanctity may grant you a long & happy life here & eternal felicity hereafter. I remain, Rev Sir, with Christian love & esteem your much obliged friend & servant in Christ John Fielding[End Page 2] Letter of Mr Fielding announcing his purpose to renounce?
