      "value": "TO THE CONGREGATION OF ST. PETER'S CHURCH. Dear Brethren :— I take this way of proposing to you a matter that has long been near to my heart, and constantly and fervently spread before God in my prayers. I ask it not for my sake only, but for Jesus' sake, nay, for your own sakes also, for if you grant it, the blessings of the Lord will, I doubt not, descend graciously and plenteouly upon you, and upon your children. To be plain and brief—the proposal is, that you resolve, God helping you, (as He will be sure to do if you trust in Him,) to defray the annual expenses of the Rev. Mr. Boone, who, as you are all, doubtless, aware [End Page 1] is shortly to go out as a Missionary to China, and that you authorize me to assume in your behalf, the payment of his salary, which will be $1000 per annum. There are in the congregation, upwards of a hundred familes. The sum of ten dollars contributed by each, furnishes the amount needed. Shall I ask if there are any families among the number, unable to make this contribution ? Shall I think that there are any unwilling? Consider the cause, dear brethren, to save souls, for which Christ died. Think what your condition and prospects had been, without the blessings of the religion of Jesus. Think what your children had been, if born in a Heathen land. Think what a trial you are to pass through at the Judgment Seat of Christ, who died as a Ransom for all, and commanded that his Gospel should be preached to all, and then inquire whether by some act of self-denial—some diminution of your ordinary expenses, luxuries possibly, but even necessaries, you cannot make up a far larger sum than will be required of [End Page 2] any of you. My brethren, I solicit this as your Pastor, who desires to see you enjoy that honor which God gives to those who honor him. But at the same time, let me remind you, that self-denial is a requisite of Christian discipleship, and covetousness is idolatry; and that no covetous person will have access to the Kingdom of Heaven. \"Prove your own selves\" then, dear brethren, and bear in mind, that your decision, and the true actual motives that prompt it, must be reviewed at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Of Mr. Boone's qualifications as a Missionary, and his prospects of usefulness, I will not now speak. His appointment to the station by the Committee to which the Church has entrusted the matter, should satisfy all who have had no opportunities of making themselves acquainted, either with him, or the condition of the people, for whose sake, he is willing to leave his country and friends. I will only express the confident hope, from the knowledge that I have been able to [End Page 3] gain, as to both these particulars, that his efforts will be signally blessed, and that the souls of converted heathen shall be his \"hire,\" and our return for the inconsiderable sum we may be called upon to contribute. Finally brethren, let me beg of you all, to spread this letter before the Lord in prayer, when you retire to your homes, and there, upon your knees, with your hearts open to God, decide how much you are able and willing through self-denial and economy, to give for the purpose of sending the Gospel to 360,000,000 Chinese. Let the sum thus fixed upon, be written upon a slip of paper with your signature appended, and dropped into the box for the \"offerings of the Church,\" this Afternoon— and it will be transcribed upon a list and the sum duly called for. That God may enlarge your hearts as well as your means, is the fervent prayer of your affectionate Pastor. W. H. BARNWELL. Charleston, March 12th, 1837. [End Page 4]"
