      "value": "Sr. John Lynch Columbia May 18th 1858 Dear Brother I might trouble you only with a few lines, knowing you must be very busily engaged, but I think you may be of service in accomplishing what I think would afford both yourself and myself pleasure viz the knowing of an employment for Bernard here which will not be fatiguing but will be respectable, the pay corresponding to the work (light), $500 a year, it is a situation at the State house in the gift of Genl Jones now filled by a son of Sr Dr Lee of Camden, it will be vacant so the Genl told me on the 1st of next month, but he had several applications ahead from the Citadel in Charleston (beneficiaries I believe) towards whom he feels a little leaning but from what little I have said and his knowledge of Bernard, I do not think it would take a great deal of persuasion for him to give B. the place. I have been thinking if you will not be up before the time, if you would write to him mentioning I had intimated such a thing to you, and expressing a wish on the subject, he would not hesitate a moment. I have consulted Father and mother and the family, they are anxious that B. should remain where he is and take the situation [End Page 1] on account of his health, for my part I believe it would be better for him than remaining idle or as is, write me if you have time and let me know your views, and what you have done (if anything)- Send our love to Louisa and Ellen and remember us to our friends. Eliza has been quite sick since Louisa left, but is getting much better, and I think everything is turning out for the best. Dr. O'Connells father is very low I thought him dying last Thursday night, but he has partially recovered and may last some little time longer, he has lost the power of articulating in a great measure, and you can hardly understand what he wishes to express, although you can see he understands every thing said to him or done about him, is in no pain, and can now swallow liquids very well, the great desire of the family and I believe of himself is that he may live to see his son who is in Rome, who will be ordained next Sunday and leave immediately for home. If you have time you will please see Mother Theresa about a letter I sent her. Ask not only for the letter I read from Salisbury, but the one I wrote to [End Page 2] herself, and give me your views how I shall act in the case, as yet I have done nothing, neither do I intend to until I hear from you, but I expect you to look through the matter dispassionately, for I fear you may some time be brought into difficulty about it and why should you is the question. You may think I am pertinacious on the subject but as I said to Mother Theresa I have been long bothered on the same subject (as you know) and knowing as much as I now do I see the case coming to a crisis, how is it to be met? Let nature take its course, and risk the consequences, or knowing how, divert the course so as to come to a favourable limitations, the latter of course as a direction I would prescribe, but will listen to any suggestions from yourself. Pray for your affectionate brother John Tell us about Robert, how he looks, his health, spirits, etc. [End Page 3] JW Lynch MA Columbia S. C no answer [End Page 4]"
