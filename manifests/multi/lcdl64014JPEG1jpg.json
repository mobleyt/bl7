      "value": "Combahee 16th Jan 1817 My Dear Mother, I must trouble you again with a few commissions, which I must beg you to get and send by the return of Marian. I suppose she will be very communicative, so that my writing you a history of the little folks; is entirely useless.- You have seen Elizabeth and her little daughter by this I dare say, and find the latter very much improved, she is treating Elizabeth; as Edward did his Mother- making her look like a ghost- which is rather a mortifying occurrence, to two such vain personages as Elizabeth and myself.-I begin to be anxious to take a peep at Sarahs son, who I am told is quite a wonder, tell Brother William, that I have been looking out for that promised letter of his, a long time, but as I have been disappointed, I conclude that he is not as much pleased with his representative, as he was at first.- I dare say if the truth was told, the child has been serenading him at nights, which has cooled him a little on the subject of his perfections.-do give my love to Sister when you see her next, I was really sorry to hear of the death of her brother, poor Mrs. Osborne is really meeting with a great many afflictions in her old age.-- [End Page 1] -I must trouble you dear Mother to get a good straw Bonnet for old Marian at Mrs. Turners or any where else trimmed with a suitable ribbon, and if you can, let her have it to wear to church on Sunday. also six nice servants handkerchiefs, 8 yds apron check, and 2 [?] salt-[pure?]. -if Mary should be in Beaufort, beg her to get me a yd of pretty Ribbons; to wear round the head, as my old one is worn out.-Your pickled oysters are very nice, also the artichokes; which I thank you very much for.- I really wish to see you dear Mother, but believe I must have patience a little longer, as its so difficult to move now, with such a large family. remember me to all my friends, and believe me dear Mother to be your Affectionate Child Hetty B. Heyward N.B. I enclose you $40 for the purpose of purchasing the articles we send for, and settling my other little accounts. [End Page 2] Mrs. Mary Barnwell. Beaufort. [End Page 3]"
