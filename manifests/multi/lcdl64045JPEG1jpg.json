      "value": "Rose Hill 9th Dec. 1834. I arrived here yesterday dear James from Beaufort then to my very great pleasure your letter was handed to me. which I determined to answer immediately as I had already began to reflect on myself for not writing to you before. particularly when I found that no one from Beaufort had written you. but however as I am now fixed at home I promise you to be a more regular correspondent and at least to write you once a month. I am sorry to tell you that I left your Gr Mother confined to her chamber by lameness. she strained both of her feet by attempting to get up from her seat while her feet were numbed by sleep. she has not left her room for several weeks but as she has now began to heal a little I hope that it will prove nothing serious and that she will soon be about again. Your Aunt Caroline is staying with her and has a Baby about a week old. which is very delicate and of course having lost so many children makes her double anxious about the least thing that ails it. The rest of her family are well and Cousin Thomas as busy as ever. they hope to go over to Ashepoo in February and occupy the new house. which they hope will be done by then. Hetty went down to Hilton Head with Sister Sally a day or two before I left. I was shocked to find that she had never written to you since her visit to Town. which seems to have pleased her very much. although I thought she must have found it very dull. she came down expecting to return [?] with me but I was detained a week later by having to change my nurse. I saw Nat several times in Beaufort and he said he was waiting to hear from you before he wrote. which I told him I thought was rather unreasonable as he certainly I hoped had the most time. he had just returned from a Party to the Hunting [End Page 1] Islands. they had fine Sport. killed ten deer and rounded altogether about fourteen. Mr. Clap killed two. but Moses Stuart thought it a dull business as he killed none at all. Nat helped to kill some but was not able to brag at all. I suppose you heard of Mr. Stuarts quiet mater. the first anyone at Beaufort knew of it was seeing it in the Papers. Although it now seems that he has been engaged ever since he came there. he certainly understands keeping a secret. he had engaged private Lodgings at Mr. [Agneve's?] for his wife and self this winter. which will make a little breach at the Bachelors Hall. indeed some think that it can't be kept together now: this seems to be Nats Holiday. for he told us that he would be at the Bluff next week. Wm Henry went to Pon Pon yesterday with your Gr Father who went to arrange Plantation affairs. they will be back tomorrow. and I will add all that Wm has to say of himself. Your Aunt Ann has determined to spend her winter in Charleston and have her Boys at Home and which I suppose under present circumstances Margaret will prefer. I hear nothing of the Wedding yet so that if you come home in six months as your Gr Father expects you may still be at the Wedding. but as I have never allowed myself to imagine such conduct from such a resolute Youth as yourself. I wont say how I shall receive you, it is grievous to see Wm Barnwell he is perfectly idle in his father's Home and disagreeable to everyone and I could hear nothing of Brother's plan's relative to him-When I was in Beaufort last Sunday Mr. Walker was away and the two Mr Johnson's preached, it was rather a singular thing to see two brothers performing the service. Richard preached in the morning and Wm in the evening. who is but twenty two years old. he did uncommonly well and with a little more practice I think will be a great Preacher. they are both married men and have their wives in Beaufort with them. Wm Elliott is to be married in Savannah to May [Nabertham?] [End Page 2] the 8th of January, and then to be ordained also Cotesworth Pinckney-Your Gr. Father and Wm. Henry returned today bringing Heyward with them and Wm. seems heartily ashamed of never having written to you but he promises to do so very soon. I am quite disappointed to find that he has no inclination to follow you and I think he had better remain in the Charleston College. he seems to miss you very much and always speaks affectionately of you. Your letter was not altogether satisfactory to me you did not tell me enough of your [page torn] whether you [?] in or out of College and who were your companions and whether you had made like of Wm letters. I think when you have time you had better write to him and give an account of yourself- he seems quite interested in you. Catharine and himself have been staying several weeks in Beaufort but have now returned to Chas. I tried to scrape up some news to tell you but could find none. the only wedding is Marianne Walker's in January and Eliza [page torn] to accompany her to North Carolina where she expects to spend the rest of her life. Nat seems to have given up all thought of Eliza but I doubt myself if he ever thought much about her and only paid her attention for amusement and as soon as he found that her family began to talk about it he stopped. Albert Smith is at the Legislature he has not been able to meet with a fortune to meet his expectation yet and therefore remains a single Man. Your Aunt and Uncle Smith always remember you. she said she would write to you soon. He has gone to Savannah. the Cholera still lurks about their Plantations but is not fatal. Did you get Sister Mary letters that we forwarded. I have not been able to see your GrFather about your request and must therefore leave it for some other letter but I shall not forget it, as you may be sure I am interested about it. much more than in your exploits to get to the Theatre- We expect your Aunt Elizabeth and family up the next week to stay as long as your GrFather has patience to keep House for them all for Arthur [End Page 3] is not up yet to assist him. I hear that Louisa is so delighted to have the house to herself that they intend to spend the Winter. but I don't know what Arthur will do for his rides in the Woods- everything goes on the same up here. killing hogs and eating sausages. which I have no doubt you would have no objection to partake of. but I continually feel glad that you went away and hope you will be able to hold out the four years. which will [?] the expectation of all your friends. for going to College and returning in six months is naturally looked for now. how do you like the freezing cold and show. I daresay the flannel Jackets, even are not sufficient, particularly to [?] in the night-time. Your GrMother told me to thank you for her letter and that nothing but her indisposition has prevented her writing and I would really recommend to you dear James to write as often as you can. for there is nothing that will be a greater advantage to you in after life than to be able to write with care-- You see I have written you quite a family Journal. you must tell me if you like long letters or not. Your Uncle George Cuthbert looked worse than anyone in Beaufort. he is very thin, and none dear James [page torn] believe me your affectionate Aunt Elz.
