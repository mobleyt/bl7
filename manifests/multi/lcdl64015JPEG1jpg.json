My Dear Mother, I receiv'd your letter a few days since, and should have reply'd to it sooner, had I not been so unwell, as to make me feel unwilling to do almost any thing.- I am glad to hear that Edward continues quite well, and I hope is very much advanced in his talking, if not- I think little Nat will soon catch him, as he begins to clap his hands, and can get up to a chair above,- he has been very sick since I wrote last.- I was afraid that weaning would go very hard with him, but he seems to be getting well now, and I hope by the time we bring him to Beaufort, will have recovered his spirits and be as well as ever.- I have bought your Doyleys, and your Hat is now in the milliner's hands and I expect will be finished to day.- you had better inquire for it, when Capt. Bythewood arrives next in Beaufort. [End Page 1] as I shall send the bandbox to Mr. Goborse; and direct it to Mr. Smith, - the box with Marys Pitchers will also be on board. I saw Sister a few days since, the children were all getting better, and they talking of leaving town some this week. Betsy is quite well, I paid her a visit last Saturday, she appeared to be very well satisfied where she was, and I suspect does not think of returning directly.- however I did not hear her say any thing relative to it, and she might intend to return sooner than I think.- I expect to see her to night at Mrs. Radcliffes masquerade, and then I hope my dissipation will end, as we go into the country the day after tomorrow, and I hope will be with you on the 18th or 20th.-I have not heard any thing of Elizabeth since I wrote last and conclude by that, she has not been to town.- we had Nat baptized yesterday which, is a great satisfaction to me, as I did [End Page 2] not like putting it off so long.-Mr. Campbell is still in town, and appears to be so well pleased that I am told he says, that he does not mean to return to Beaufort until the Church is finished.- a piece of scandal I suppose you will say.-I hope you received my letter by Mrs. Stuart, and the Kiss is for Edward, do kiss him for me.- Mr. Heyward desires to be remember'd to you, and with my love to all I remain your affec. child Hetty B. Heyward. P.S. Old Marian begs you to [page torn] her children know that she is quite well, and will soon see them.- You will find a small box, on board Capt Bythe. vessel, with two glass mugs, which we beg you to accept.
