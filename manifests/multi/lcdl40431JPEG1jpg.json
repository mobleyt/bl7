      "value": "Beaufort SC August 29th We have all been wondering why no letter has come from you or [illegible] you dear Mama, but hope that no news is in this case too, good news. A letter from Papa to you we received on Friday and read -- it had a message for Miss [Fogartie?] which you will doubtless be glad to write her, so if you say so we will send you the letter. A short one from Robbie to you came this morning but it had nothing much in it. To say we do not [hourly?] miss you would be too untrue, still [illegible] measure you can quiet your mind concerning our welfare. Cattie has taken charge of the house entirely and attends to it more faithfully then on former occasions. Hettie charge of cloth, work, and the seamstress. I have the direction of your [illegible] washers and endless washing. It is perhaps the easiest but I hate it for all [illegible]. What a quantity of clothes we[End Page 1] manage to [illegible] thro' every week. It is amusing sometimes Cattie says \"the sugar, [rice?] potatoes everything goes so fast and yet we don't have but what is necessary.\" \"Yes\" but we are so many in number,\" cries some consoling spirit. Hettie says \"There is so much work to be done, work, work, work, and yet it don't seem to show.\" \"Yes but see the number of children\" says the same kind voice. \"[illegible] Nancy where do these clothes come from, positively it is wash, wash, wash, soap, soap, starch. \"Oh yes maam but de chilan wear um, must [illegible] two sets a day.\" Ah well my dear Mama you have a brave heart to live thro' it all. To be sure they are all your own and that I suppose makes a difference. Sassard did not come on Saturday, and we have already begun on Stephen's [fire?]. As long as we continue peacibly and have good accounts of all with you however these troubles are trifling. Cattie taught [Patty?] to make a grist bread which cannot [fail?] so we enjoy our breakfast meal more than formerly. Beaufort is dull enough but[End Page 2] healthy. Uncle Robert sprained his leg again very badly, getting on a horse it turned and throwing him stepped upon his leg. Dr. Gibbes set it, but it gave, and still gives much pain. Some think he will feel it for life. Aunt Martha has returned -- we sent back the cow -- yours gives nearly as much milk and the calf is in decent order. Mr Wilmot Gibbes, the father of Ben's wife is here, he dines today at GF's. Charlie is well and perhaps fatter. He does better at school only missing one and two words. Hettie allows that he has improved vastly in reading. [illegible] Hannah is with Aunt Meta still she will come home this week and what is surprising for her says she wants to. Ste went to L. B. last week he goes again tomorrow, but wants Willie back very much. We all miss him and hope soon to see him. Give our love in a great measure to Papa who I hope is with you far away from Columbia. I will send this to Robbie to forward. Yrs affectionately Bet[End Page 3]"
