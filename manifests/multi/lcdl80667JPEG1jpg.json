      "value": "Camp at Mount Poverty\nalias Sisters [illegible] on the\nRiver Savannah. March 19.\n1779.\n\nI Recd. [received] my Dear Father two Letters having\ndate the 8th and 10th inst: and found myself relieved from\nthe anxiety I had suffered on Acct. [account] of your long Silence.\nIt was near three weeks since I had Rec.d [received] the least\nIntimation of your being Well and the Family in\nHealth; how exceedingly agreeable then was the good\nNews! The Regret that my Friends feel because\nI was not arrived in Gen: [General] Ashes Camp and the\nSuccess which They imagine would have ensued\nhad the Detachment under my Command been\nengaged is a mere illusion; be assured, Sir,\nthat if forty thousand Men had come to the\nassistance of Gen: [General] Ashe the day before, that,\nunder the same Circumstances, they must have\nbeen all totally Routed. a Handful of Men\nwill defeat Ten times their Number, whom they [illegible]\nsurprize [surprise] them. This being actually the Case and had I\nbeen present nothing lay in my Power with Regard\n\n[End page 1]\n\nto the Security of the Camp in General, nothing\nbut the Care of my own Department coming under\nmy immediate Consideration and Conduct, that I\ncould not have prevented a Surprise; in all\nHuman Probability I should have been Compelled\nto partake of the dishonorable flight with\nthe whold Army and with difficulty preserved my\nLife. Your Account of Gen: [general] Pulaski with his\nLegion coming to Our Assistance is truly flattering\nand much to be desired; but I fear that his Number\nis not so great as five thousand, as I am\nwell assured that his Command is only 500-\nbut even this Support of Regular Troops is\nwell worth, an addition of two thousand Militia.\nGen: [general] Williamson We Hear has thrown a body of\nEleven Hund.d [Hundred] Men, Horse and Foot, into Georgia, with\nsome Secret Design. It is imaged He wants to\ndraw the attention of the Enemy again towards\nAugusta, that He means to drive off that\ngreat quantity of Stock, which is in the back\nCountry of Georgia, to Dispossess them of a Port\nat Paris' Mill upon Bryar Creek on to Surprise\nthe Militia at Col. [colonel] [Sharps?] Regt. [regiment]: all\nTories who were lately ordered to be M[illegible].\n\n[End page 2]\n\nWe have as yet not been acquainted with the\nResult, but expect to hear every Moment of some\nSuccess which is most Ardently wished him. Gen: [General]\nAshe solicited a Court of Enquiry upon his\nConduct, which was granted him: He was\nacquitted of Cowardice, but found Guilty of\nNegligence in not defending his Camp. Gen: [General]\nBryan the Second in Command is also much\nblamed and it is supposed will be Arrested for\nhaving always endeavoured to set the People\nagainst Gen: [General] Ashe, which has a tendency to\nMutiny. Two Deserters, from Hudson's Ferry\nabout 15 Miles higher up than this Port, both\nScotch Lads inform us that the Enemy are making\nrafts at the place whence they Came with an intention\nof Crossing over, as soon as they should\nreceive Intelligence of Our Numbers stationed\nin Gen: [General] Rutherfords Encampment and described the\nMan who was sent as a Spy amongst Us. The\nDescription suited exactly One Letter a\nDutchman who was confined in our guard\nhere, having here taken up several Days before\n\n[End page 3]\n\nwhere you will find the Return mentioned\nby Col. [Colonel] Drayton, but Believe I delivered it\nto Gen: [General] Howe, with the Remainder of his\nPapers. I make no doubt that our bar being\nshut up by the Enemy's Privations, will be\nthe means of increasing the necessaries of\nLife; with us the Pace of every thing is at\na Scandalous Pitch of Extravagance. Nothing\nbut a Speedy End of the War, can possibly save\nus all, from Poverty and Pain, but while it\nContinues, I shall deem myself bound to remain\nin the Army. How much more preferable\nis it to be in the Continental Regular\nService at present than in any Corps\nof Militia; You have things which are necessary\nprovided for you and the soldier becomes\nRespected in proportion as the Danger\nincreases. This is the Juncture, when,\nto be a Soldier, is Honorable.-\nI am D Sir [Dear Sir] with Affection\nYour Obt: [Obedient] and Sincere Son\nJohn F: Grimke\n\n[To:] John Paul Grimke Esq:\n\n[End page 4]\n\nhaving nearly gone thro. the whole Encampment,\nHe had a very [Musquet?] and [Cartouch?] Box, the\nG:R. he had [Erased?], as also the Crown, which\nall his British Majesty: Goods are [illegible]\nwith. He was immediately bound and sent down\nto Purishburgh with the Two Deserters. They\nfrom then Say that 1000 Indians were Expected\nto Join them, and that they Saw the ration\n will made out for that Purpose. They have\n 1200 Men at Ebenezer, 400 at Govr. [Governor] Treutons,\n almost opposite to this Ferry, and 1200 at Hudsons:\n The Light Infantry under the\n Command of Capt: [Captain] McDonald are Stationed\n near Paris' Mill on Bryor Creek: Campbell and Sir\n James Baird are both Embarking for England:\n Gen: [general] Prevort is Govn: [Governor] of Georgia and\n that Cols. [Colonel] Prevort has the sole Command of\n the Army. They Deny two Regt. [Regiments] having marched\n to Susannah to Embark for Port Royal, but\n acknowledge to have heard that the vessels were\n taking in water. I have Rec.d [received] my Tent and am much\n Obliged to you for it. I cannot Refer you to\n \n[End page 5]\n \n [To:] John Paul Grimke Esq:\n\n[End page 6]"
