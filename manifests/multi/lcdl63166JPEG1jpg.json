Calhoun \nto John Forbes\nFort Hill\n17th May 1831\nDear Sir\nI received yours of the 10th March \nafter my return to my residence here, and \nhave been prevented from an earlier acknow-\nledgement by the number and extent of my \ndomestick and other engagements. \nI am much gratified to learn, that my \ncourse in reference to the correspondence, was \nso well received by my friends in Ohio. \nThe subject was a very painful one to me, \nbut I would have been wanting in duty to \nmyself and to my constituents, had I declined \nmeeting it as I did against so formidable \na conspiracy, backed by the power and influence \nof the Executive branch of the Government. \nI had no other refuge but in the virtue \nand intelligence of the people and in which \nI have found ample protection. The attacks, \nwhich have been since been made on me, \nand to which you refer, are intended for \ndiversion, and is a conclusive evidence of \nthe failure of the plot. I have not the least \nobjection, that any sentiment I ever uttered, \nor even entertained should be known to the \npublick [public]; and would be gratified to bring out \nfully, if a suitable occasion offered my \nsentiments on the all important points of \nthe origin and true character of the general \n[Page Two]\ngovernment, and the relative powers of it \nand the state governments; on a proper under--\nstanding of which, I am of the opinion. The \nUnion, the liberty and prosperity of our Country \ndepends. On these points my opinion are \nnot novel. They are the old Republican – \ndoctrines of ’98, and you will find them \nfully described in the Virginia report and \nresolutions, the Kentucky resolutions, and \nthe decision of Chief Justice McKean of \nPensylvania. I go to their extent, and \nno farther; and if by nullification they – \nare meant, I am a nullifier, the word has \nnever been one of my using, but, if on the \ncontrary, it be meant a disunionist, a – \ndisorganizer, an anarchist, never was a \nword more misapplied. I never – \nbreathed a sentiment of the kind; and \nso far from it, that I have ever held the \nUnion of these states, as the greatest blessing, \nnext to Liberty itself; and which, in \nmy opinion can only be maintained by \ndefending the just rights and powers of the \nState to their full extent. \nwith sincere regard\nI am [illegible]\nto \nJohn Forbes Esq. signed J. C. Calhoun"
