      "value": "February 20, 1948\nMr. Armant Legendre\n433 Gravier Street\nNew Orleans, La.\nDear Armant,\nThis letter of thanks to you is very much de-\nlayed due to the traveling we have been doing. af-\nter leaving New Orleans, Morris and I went on to\nCharlotte, and there in a weak mement,due to our ex-\nertions at Mardi Gras,we took over the franchise for\nDrink-O-Mat in North Carolina in addition to holding\nit in South Carolina. We spent most of Wednesday\nnight talking with lawyers, and then on Thursday\nclosed the deal,and made a quick survey of the thea-\nters in that part of the country. we then came down\nhere, amd Morris went back to Aiken, where he was to\nstay Sunday night and then return to Washington for\nhis new post. However, on reaching there he was\nthreatened with pneumonia, and has been in bed in\nAiken over since. I speak to him on the telephone\noccasionally, and he still is feeling quite badly.\nNow for the big story that you will really\nlike. For some time I have been priming Gertrude\nfor a trip to Valdosta, Georgia, where there was to\nbe a forestry association convennion. I was suppose\nto make a speach there, and also wanted to hear all\nthe other speach makers to find out what was the lat-\nest things in forestry. Gertrude said she would go\nand accordingly we set out on Tuesday in the car to\nmotor the 300 miles. We arrived in Valdosta about\n8.30 in the evening, and I asked a man on the corner\nwhere the Hotel Heidelburg was, as this is where I\nHad my reservations. He said he had never heard of\nit, and I muttered what a stupid man, and went on\nuntil I found a policeman and asked him where the\nhotel was. Be also said that he had never heard of\nit. Gertrude, by now, was a little bit angry and\n[End Page 1]\n-2-\nvery hungry, and said lets get something te eat\nso we went into a little restaurant. While there,\nshe said, \"I think you have the wrong town\". I\nlaughed at this, but went out to the car and brought\nin my letter file just to prove te her that we were\nin the right town. In opening up the file, I read\nthe letter from the Forestry Association whose head-\nquarters is in Valdosta. It said, \"Dear Mr. Legendre:\nThis is to anounce that we are having our annual meet-\ning in Jackson Missippippi\".When I read that Gertrude\nlet out such a shout that you oould have heard it\nback at Medway. She roared with laughter for at least\nhalf an hour, and was absolutely unable to eat any-\nthing, as everytime she started she would laugh again.\nWe discovered that Jackson, Miss.  was 550 miles\naway from us, and that our whole trip was in vain.\nWe slept in a tourist court that might and motored\non to Thomasville the next day to see Jock Whitney's\nplace, and speak to his manager about quail and tim-\nber, but the main point of our trip of course was\nlost. Now when ever I say anything, Gertrude just\nsays, \"Remember Valdosta⁵.\nI was terribly sorry that you became so tired\non my last light there, and I wanted to explain a\nremark that I made in case you took it the wrong\nway, as I think you did. You will recall that I had\nsaid, 'If he is in such a bad temper, let him go\nhome.⠂y this I was critizing your temper, but the\nfact that everyone was continually trying to push\nand pull you to keep going and to come along. They\nwould take turns urging you, and It made me furious\nbecause when one is tired there is nothing worst than\nbeing forced and begged to come on and have a good\ntime. That is why I told them to let you go home\nand step begging you to stay. It was not in any\nsense a critism of your temper, because I flared up\na little later in the evening quite a bit myself\ndue to being exhausted. Honestly Armant, I think\nthat you are foolish to let yourself bark as hard\nas you do,and than let them push you into a little\nroom like that, and take away tose conforts of liv-\ning that you deserve. Children really do not ap-\npreciate it, and though you may think you are giv-\ning them a good time actuallyy it makes very little\ndifference and all you do is to suffer. Also I\n[End Page 2]\n-3-\nthink you become as ever as you were, amd as a result\nperhaps suffers relapse of your eye or stomach is\nridiculous. For what purpose is it, absolutely none\nand strongly advise you to take that fine front\nroom, and say this is my room for ever and ever, and\nnobody else can ever have it. I would also refuse\nto go out when you are tired, and I know that you\nrealise that Morris and I do not want or expect you\nto out with us when we are down there if you are not\nfeeling well. We certainly would not go out with\nyou if we were tired, but would go to bed as you well\nknow.\nThank you ever so much though for everything\nyou did for me while I was in New Orleans,and all\nthe trouble that you took to get me into Syntax,\nand showing me around. I really did appreciate your\ncoming down to the padle, as I know you did not want\nto and it is such fun seeing you that I always love\nmy visits to New Orleans.\nI know that it is almost useless to ask you\nto come up here, but perhaps somehow business will\nbring you into our part or the world this spring,\nand you will stay with me and drink a little corn\nwhisky. We are all breaking up so quickly that I\nwant to grasp every possible moment together, be-\ncause these are the times I emjoy myself most.\nLove,\nSidney\n[End Page 3]\n[appears to be an alternative Page 3]\n-3-\nAm afraid your stomach and eyes will go back on\nyou if you let yourself get so over tired.\nThank you ever so much though for everything\nyou did for me while I was in New Orleans,and all\nthe trouble that you took to get me into Syntax,\nand showing me around.
