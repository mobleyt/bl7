      "value": "My dear Sister, \nI hope you were not all [melted?] by the extreme heat of the weather, before this [delightful?] change? -- delightful to the feelings, but [per]haps too sudden to be very salutary. I understand some of our Charlestonians have described very forcibly their sufferings from want of air, their gasping for breath; but had they been here in the neighbourhood of the sea, they would have found the weather very oppressive from the middle of July to the middle of August.\nMrs. Dent is amongst the visitors to the North this summer, and went to Philadelphia to see her old friend Miss Gadsden, who was not at home when she called; walking back to her lodgings she met her, and of course addressed her; but Miss G. [Gadsden] had not the most distant recollection of her, so greatly was her appearance changed by her style of dressing. It seems that her Daughters have always been petitioning that she would attend more to her dress but without effect; this circumstance they hope will cause the desired improvement, as she found her friend dressed very nicely and fashionably, and looking extremely well and young.\n[end of page one]\n[Illegible due to water damage] had been much [illegible] to this but season -- Mrs. Skivoing was not sufficiently amused [illegible due to water damage] [remain?] there after\na week or two; and yet she could[would?] not have it, as there was no party she could[would?] accompany, or unegaged Beau to escort her. I think she is quite competent so taking care \nof herself and Sister too by this time; and on the score of Beaux, it would be much more dignified not to consider them so indispensable to her movements. We should forgive her however this youthful feeling, if she could draw off the old beaus from his present pursuit, and attach him to her assistance now, and forever.\nMr. Henry Cruger has married a Miss Douglas of New York Who is not handsome, has red hair, and is eleven years older than himself in the other seale she has half a million which she thought not too much for him and would not settle any part of it on herself; but after the marriage he very properly and generously settled on her $300,000.\nI have heard of your being seen in North Carolina I rejoice that you have at length got off, and comminced your journeyings; which I hope will give you freer respiration and more general comfort. Only think of my forgetting your Candles -- It was only the other day I came across a memoranda in which they were [mentioned]\n[end of page two]\n[mentioned] I will [illegible due to water damage] are in motion. Which writing [illegible] walk in four dollars for you as if she had done great things. I have not seen this Pinckneys, they were out when catted. They gave a large and brilliant party east week. Yes, we are to have another Episcopal Church here -- a presbyterian Cady said to me, [illegible] very significantly, at least, she intended to do so, rather maliciously; so you are to have extempores prayers, four day meetings, and night meetings in your Church! I was almost tempted to tell her that I hoped all such deviations from the form of the true Church might be confined to her own mode of worship. But it is suspected that it will be what is called an Evangelic Church. I am told [illegible due to tear in the page] good authority that this arrangement was [illegible due to tear in the page] did have with mr. Barnwell's knowledge, before he proceded to Pendleton. Mr. Barnwell Smith Fund preeminent amongst the active members.\nSeptember 7th, I saw the Pinckneys she cast evening with so much to say in quick succession that it was impossible to retain half. They amused us with an account of their respectable substitues or men at Arms at P-s[Pawley's] Island; three overseers whom they brushed up furnishing them with new uniforms suits and good cavalry. They are requested to patronize a Literary and Philosophical Ball the object of which is to enable a society to purchase glass cases\n[end of page three]\n[illegible due to water damage] would be otherwise [illegible due to water damage] This is the is the present practice of doing things now in Europe. Mrs. Skivoing has been ill at [illegible due to water damage] Springs and Mrs. Pringle has been kindly nursing [illegible due to water damage] since which she has been ill herself. Ann Gard is said to be engaged to Mr. Walter Blake. I requested [Harriet?] to let me have your account, which was at your [illegible due to water damage], but she positively refused.\n[continued after a break in the page]\nEdward hopes to go to the College in Columbia some time in October. Arthur will then be the only one remaining with us the next winter. I still think the first 17 years of married life its happiest season, it is then one family and almost one mind; after which follows separation of members and separate desires, wishes, interests. We are all well, dear Ann even looks well, and says she is as strong as ever she was in her life. Where are the Petries? Do you hear from\n[continued written vertically on the right side of the page]\nMary Shands? How is your old friend Mrs. Calhoun, amused I hope with the prospect from her [window?]. My love to all with you [my dear?] Sister and may God bless you! -- [illegible due to tear in page] C. [Charlotte] Manigault.\n[written vertically in the center of the page, opposite text above but facing the other direction]\n[stamp] Charleston S.C.[South Carolina] Sep[September] 12  \n[in different ink] 1834\nMiss Drayton.\nPendleton Village \nSo. Carolina."
