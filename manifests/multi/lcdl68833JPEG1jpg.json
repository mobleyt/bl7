Sidney J.Legendre U.S.N.R.\nP.O.166\nNavy No 128\nCommandant\nFleet Post Office\nSanFransisco, Cal.\nGertrude S.Legendre\nO.S.S.Detachment\nA.P.O.887\nPostmasterNew York\nR 2 17 44 Jan 31st '44\nDear Sidney,\nMonday morning again. Instead of being able to say I\nplayed golf, went swimming, or sunbathed- I report that I took a\nwalk in a very crouded park with Ben and watched doodles scurry about\non the grass. It was muddy, mild and quite pleasant,and I was\nfurious not to be in the country golfing. All my pals had gone off\nshooting for the week and and I was not in on it. I saw a dull movie\nin the afternoon which was much too long and went early to bed.\nSaturday while reading\"So Little Time\"- an excellent\nbook you would love, and listeneing to the radio the windows started\nto rattle and I got quite a kick out of it. No doubt the papers \nreported terrific doings as they always do in the states, but I\nassure you they exaggerateterribly. I lay in bed, never moved a muscle\nwent on reading, and quite enjoyed the feel of the thing. Sonidering\nyou read about it in the papers I dont see why I cant talk about it -\nbut there it is- you cant. Windows are rattling thes[e] days in quite\na few alces over the world,so I dont see how the enemy can know\nwhat place I am talking about. Maybe thiswill all be censored and\nyou will never get it, [I] dont know.\nI had a letter from Ellen this morning telling me she\nhas gone to P.B. for the winter and was so thrilled to be down there\nin the warm and the sunshine. She is becomming a nurse's Aid.\nJohnnie S. got back from a quick trip the other day and had a\nbeautiful time quail shooting in Tallahassee .He was full of\nenthusiasm about his trip.Had seen masses of people and had a grand\nbreak. \nI got so many V mail form you all on one day I shall\nprobably not get anymore for ages.\nLots of love to you, and take an extra duck underthat\nblue pacific water for me. I envy you so much.\nSo long darling, I have little news, but I love you\nso much., and miss you terribly.\nI am going to a Foxcroft Reunion tomorrow which sounds\npretty funny does n't it? but there are quite a lot of girls here[,]\nand as tomorrow is Miss Charlotte's birthday- we are having a\nlunch, about twelve of us I think.\nLots of love-\nGertrude Legendre"
