      "value": "Charleston 5th Aug 1818 My dear Mother, I receiv'd your letter by the boat yesterday evening, also the water melons which I assure you are very acceptable, I have just eat one and found it very good indeed. - your salt is now at Mr. Osborns waiting for the boat, which probably will not leave town before tomorrow evening, Mrs. Matthews sent me word to day that June was sick with the fever, which will throw them into a little confusion I suppose. - poor Mr. Campbell I have not heard what they have determined to do in regards to him, it must have been a great shock to the Percys, for I understand they had not heard of his situation.- James is better than when I wrote to Sally, but is still very unwell, he has fallen away almost to a skeleton, the rest of the Children are well, they were delighted with the watermelons. - I hope the Homespun will answer which I send for Elizabeth. do give my love to all my friends and believe me dear Mother to be Your ever Affectionate Child Hetty B. Heyward-- [End Page 1] Sandfords Bank - $2..50c 4 bushels Salt --- 2..43 3/4 Drayage and cooperage ..43 3/4 6 yds Homespun --- 3..00 ______ $20..87c left in my hands.
