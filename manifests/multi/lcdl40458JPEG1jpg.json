      "value": "Gottingen Prussia October 1st 1869 Dear Mamma Much to my delight the first letter from home was received on Tuesday last without accident, and in 17 days from its leaving Beaufort. I am [so] glad to hear of your general enjoyment of Bay Point, as well as of the pleasures of having company with you. You did not mention Stephen in your letter, but suppose that may be taken as a [mark] of his being well. Since my last letter I have little new to tell, beyond my continued good health and spirits and uninterrupted progress in German. I made, however, as an episode, a trip to Hesse Cassel, to see the Picture Gallery and Water Works, and had a most charming day. A description of my performances there, I sent to Bet the beginning of the week, and you can write to her for it, if you please. As the end of the two months approaches, I am obliged to look about me and determine whether I will keep these rooms, or find others. As things look at present, I think I shall stay where I am,[End Page 1] our landlady, being very kind, and everything neat and nice. Hayne [and?] self find we get on so well with always speaking German, that we shall in all probability remain together. The expenses being much less when two are together, and the pleasure of company are two points which are of much weight with us, and I think should be so. Our American friends here are rapidly on the increase, and far from wanting society the danger at present is in having too much of it. The temptation to speak English is wonderfully strong, but we are very self-denying, and often [tear] ourselves away and turn to our books. [This?] week, our teacher having gone for a visit to [his] friends, we have holiday, and I for one have been employing it in writing letters to America. As to what you mentioned about writing from New York, I had very good reasons I think for not doing so, and am curious to know whether it was only E's fancy or not. A horrid thing indeed! Richard Fuller's death. You remember I saw him the summer I was first with you, and thought him as wonderfully smart. I had afterwards that his uncle was educating him, and[End Page 2] had [really] hoped we would have one more educated, talented, South Carolinian in the present dearth of strong men. Please express my sympathy if you have a chance. Glad to hear Captain Allard has lit on his feet again but fear he will never have so easy a man to deal with as Ferguson. No chance I suppose of his doubling his cares for some time. I suppose I have one heavy indictment against your letter, it was by half too short. Don't be afraid of putting in paper. One stamp will carry as [much] [as] [you] care to write, so have no fears [and] put in anything in the shape of news that yo can -- about the crop, about the negroes, about Beaufort, all is acceptable, and will be sure of eager reading. If you can not send a stray paper cut out a few items and put them in your letter. Everything in Europe here is in an anxious condition about the health of Napolean, and the troubled state France seems to be in. Prussia, which since the war of '66 has been almost the leading European power, is herself by no means quiet, and will it is thought be much disturbed, by quarrels between[End Page 3] the King and Parliament -- the latter [being] very unwilling to endure the expense of the monstrous army always on hand. The perfect [control] which the army exercises over the people [who] support it, and the contempt shown by the officers for civilians, is to an American very strange, and to me extremely distasteful. It [illegible] quite curious to see the people here, who have [illegible] been, conquered -- very different from us, for they lost nothing, but often no less violent in their abuse. The officials, however, who three years ago were all [Hanoverians?] [and?] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] King George, are now fast Prussians and just as faithful to King William. You of course, know that I am in a different part of Germany from Brother Robert -- he being down at Erlangen in South and I in Gottingen in North Germany -- I mean most of his time for he was also in Berlin. Hoping to get a letter from some members of the family each week, and with much love to all I am Your Son Jos W. Barnwell Mrs. C O Barnwell Beaufort[End Page 4]"
