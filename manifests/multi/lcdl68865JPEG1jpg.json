      "value": "M 6 22 43\nR 7 2 43\nJune 21st '45\nDear Sidney, \nIt is a very hot night and I am sitting in my bedroom\nwith the air conditioner battling the temperature, and inspite of all\nthe hard work the machine is doing the thermometer registers 90[percent].\nTo-day a cable came through from London giving my job\ndescription for my pastport so it look sas though I really will get\noff sometime in July for London. I hope it will turn out to be as interes\n-ting and exciting as I think it will be. Considering that the next\nfive months should settle the europeans war[,]I feel they should be\nvery exciting days ahead. I hope I shall not be dissapointed and\nvery lonely. There is always that side to it ofcourse.\nIf I could be going Pacif_icwards in_stead of the other\nway I would ofcourse like it a whole lot better. I do wish the Navy\nwould not have such foolish rigid rules.\nWorking for David will be nic_e,because he is understanding,\nand will allow me to resign if need be shou_ld you be transf_ered home.\nL ater on if the London offic_e decreases I h_ope to get sent to the\nother sid_e of the world to do a job f_or the Jap campaine. My be our\npaths will c_ross bef_ore the war is oger , I am always hoping that some\nh_ow they will .\nI have entered Landine in the Metarie Park Country Day\nSchool at Olive's advice- for next wint_er. I have taken three of her\nrooms for the kids[,]and I think it will all work out very well.\nRose will of course be the roving acomplice that attends to everything.\nThe children, the Plantation, sending forg otten articles[,]and attending\nto everything. I must say without Rose I would not have the same feeling\nof perfect confidence that I have knowing she is there ready for\nanything. \nMiss Evans wrote me to-day the kids were wonderful,\nenjoying lif_e to the fullest, that Landine was no problem at all ,\nand that everything wasrunning smoolthly,and that they were all very\nhappy.- including Honey.\nI am so glad their summer is such a success.\nI expect to go over on a queen boat sometime next month. Iam\nallowed 175 lbs. and I expect to live at Claridges when I get there.\nThere are no servants to be had for a house, and only at a hotel can you\nget bathtowels and have your shoes cleaned and clothes pressed. So I think\nI shall stay there untel something else turns up, somebody might invite m\nme to visit then although I doubt it. I expect to have the same type of\nJob over there,but perhaps being a little closer to the front it will have\nmore zest and excitement than Washington. I am hoping so. The whole\nthing is a gamble and I may be bitterly disspaointed. The old refrain-\n\"not_hing ventured nothing gaind_d\" is what [I] believe. As long as I\nc ant get to H a waii I don t mu_c_h care where I am,so I might as well\nt_ry and get as muc_h interest and thrill out of the war as possible, so Il\nthink being over there is better than here- so thats that.\nIt is quite a step to take all by myselfas I have never traveledalone bef\n-fore. I feel I have gotten all there is to get out of Washington after\na year of it[,]and a change of scene is quite a thrill. My feelings are\nvery mixed[,]and have moment_s whe[n?] wonder whethe_r have made\nthe right discision.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nMaking up on[e's] mind all alone, deciding what is right and wrong, and\nthen going ahead with it is awfully upsetting. I dont like it at all.\nI am truly lost without you. I feel so alone and solitary. No one to\ntalk a thing over with or discuss it with. Just oneself, ones own self \nin bed alone,and I am tortured with doubt and qualms. Its very painful.\nWell its decided now,and come whatmay I am underway. It wont be long\nnow till I get off. Going furthur away from you - furthur in miles in dis-\ntance for mail is not a pleasant thought, but then there is no really\npleasant thought unless I was taking a boat to Honolulu,which is my idea\nof getting to heaven , for it would be heaven if I could see you again_\nN OW,without waiting till the war with Japan has come to an end.\nI went to Chevey Chas_e yesterday. Marion Hollins was with\nme and we lunched with Edith Munson and her brother, Lester, and some\none called ADAMS. They golfed and I tennised,and we had a lovely day of \nexercise and sunshine. They all came back to my house for supper after-\nwards and Rose had cold lobsters,and salad,and ice cream and it was deli-\ncious. Murry and Lanier came too, and Maurice Fatio who has just come\nto Washington. We had a very early evening,and Marion and I tried to sleep \nand get cool in the airconditioned bedroom but it was as hot as now [percent]90.\nThe summeer is here with a vengeance and you drip from morning to night. \nPerspiration pores from ones brow every minute of the day[,]and everything\nsticks.\nMarion tells me San Pedro is a very dreary spot. Not at all\nattractive. Its that flat part between Los Angeles and La Jolla near the\noil wells on the way south. Nothing like as attractive as La Jolla or\nanything like Ranch_o SantaFe, or Del[M]onty, Carmel etc etc or around\nSantaBarbarbara. Marion is living in a house on Cypress Point Golf Course\nnow[,]and says she has had a terrific reel estate season this year. Every\none is buying.\nMrs James Dunn who was at Chevy Chase yesterday tells me\nthat nothing in California can coppare to Hawaii. She has lived in both\nplaces and claims there is no comparison. You ahve the vegetation where\nyou are. No dust storms or aridness,and far more even climate. I think\nyou must find the house,so when the war is over I can move out and join\nyou with the kids. I am told the schools there are excellent too.\nHawaii is as good a base as any because with aviation what it is going to\nbe after this war--- we can go any place any time very cheap in no time.\nDistance will be nothing. All of us will have heliacopters too.\nI am looking forward to the world when this is over because I think it\nwill beas different as the horse and buggy days were to the automobile.\nI am looking forward to your next letter and hope it will arrive\nto-morrow. Your last was June 1oth.\nLots of love my darling and I shall arrange a telephone call\nprobably to-morrow.\nAll my love-\nGertrude\n[End Page 2]"
