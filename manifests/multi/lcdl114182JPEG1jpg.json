      "value": "July 26, 1929\n\nMy dear Miss Bragg:\n\n\tPerhaps you have the same expression as our Chinese,\"it is easy to part from one another; but it is hard to meet one another after de--parture.\" Yesterday the first part of this expression applied to us. How easily we four boys separated from each other! Colonel went his way to New York City, Sergeant and Major--better are they two--their way to Ithaca, and I came to Buffalo. I am now for the first time feeling myself surrounded by foreigners though in reality I am the only foreigner among them. However I do not feel lone--some, for before my arrival at here in Buffalo I had Hawthorne's \"pleasure of imagination\" which kept me to look forward for something wonderful, [2] pleasantly curious, grand. By four o'clock, this afternoon, the pleasure of imagination became that of memory. Unlike Hawthorne, I did not feel, however, disappointed right after the picture of Niagara Falls had impressed on my brain. What was my feeling or how did I feel and am feeling is hard to express. I had seen falls in Watkins Glen [New York state] and Ausable Chasm [New York state]. They were beautiful, but can not be compared with the falls i saw this afternoon. Nature after all is almighty. Her piece of work as Niagara Falls can never, I believe, be created by human skillful manipulation.\n\n\tTo--morrow morning I shall take bus to Meadville, Pa. and I expect to be there by three o'clock in [3] the afternoon.\n\n\tHalf of my summer vacation has past [sic]. Yet not one single book did I read. I am very afraid that I should have retrograded a great deal during this summer. The climate in the north, especially in Plattsburg and Buffalo, is delightful to read. But I can find no place for this purpose. I do not know how is the weather in Columbus, Ohio. Anyway it cannot be so nice as here.\n\n\tBoth Sergeant and Colonel plan to go to Cornell University this fall if they fail in their applications for their respective advanced military schools. It is much better, of course, for them to succeed in the latter, but nothing is much regretful if they study in Cornell.\n\n\tYours affectionately,\n\n\tLittle Captain\n\n[From:] F.L. Wong\nHotel Buffalo\nBuffalo, N.Y.\n\n[Addressed:] Miss Laura M. Bragg\n38 Chalmers Street\nCharleston, S.C.\nValentine Museum\nRichmond, Va\n\n[Endorsed:] NOTICE\nLetters mailed in hotel envelopes, if not delivered are sent to the Dead Letter Office unless the writer gives a return address.\nIf not delivered in ____ days, return to \nC.K. Wang\n41 W. Frambes Ave., Columbus, Ohio"
