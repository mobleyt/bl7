      "value": "OBJECTIVES OF THE Carolina ART  Association  The New York Herad Tribune of last Juy 17th  said: \"To seek out and accept new responsibiities-this  might be caed the motto of the Carolina Art Associaltion,  which during recent years has changed from being simpy  an art museum to a many sided art institution.\"  It is the motto of the Carolina Art  Association  and has received the attention of five phianthropic foundations, who have, since 1933, made grants of over $85,000  to our work with the Gibbes Gallery, the Dock Street Theatre, Publications and the Civic Services Committee. Businessmen in the last year have contributed over $12,000.  Our yeary budget has grown in 13 years from $2,500- to  $60,000. Publications by the  Association have sent out  9,000 copies of 3 books on Charleston, the last one, THIS  IS Charleston, being commented on by the Roya Institute  of British Architects as being \"a mode of how such a job  should be done.\" The Institute-aso said: \"The citizens  of Charleston have now the best possible incentive to care  for their architectural heritageh  We are a many sided institution and the fact  that it is approved of by the city is clearly evidenced  by our last year\"s enroment of 2,700 members.  We have as our objective the stimuation of  interest in the arts in the broadest sense for the whole  community, to present a variety of what is current in  fine arts at the Gibbes Art Gallery, to give the best  possible theatre fare commensurate with our means at the  Dock Street Theatre, and to make every effort to prove  to the city that the preservation of Charlestons architectural heritage is of great economic importance.  We need members for support and as friends and  co-workers. We quite realize that you are making sacrifices to hep us make the Art  Association an institution  of usefuness to Charleston and want you to know that it  cannot be accompished without the assistance of many people.  Our campaign for members opens on September the  24th at 6:00 p.m. at the Dock Street Theatre. Other meeting dates and instructions for the campaign will be sent  to you in ampe time."
