      "value": "Now for my prediction, Before 20 days this part of the Coast of South Carolina will be invaded by a large force, that force will take North Island  Fortify it. this will give the enemy full control of these Rivers Waccamaw, Black River, Big Pee Dee and Little Pee Dee. They will either occupy Georgetown or Burn it. They will then send large armed parties up the Rivers amongst the Rice farms, Cut the Rice Banks thereby destroying the crop of Rice and will sweep off the Negroes by the Thousands.\n[End Page 1]\nWhat can't be carried off will fall a waste before the Bullet, the Knife and the torch. All this I believe will happen unless a kind and Merciful God interposes his shield to protect this truly unprotected Country, from the ravages of an enemy whose tenderest mercies are such cruelties that a Devil would blush to follow their example. God pity these people who have been so smitten with the Virginia fever as to leave home and homes Altars deserted ready to the hand of the destroyer whenever I have foreshadowed this state of things, I\n[End Page 2]\nhave been sneered at, and tauntingly told that, old men and boys could take care of Home, but Men ought to go to Virginia to fight the enemy where he could be found. I may be selfish in my Patriotism but my Heart throbs at the name of Carolina its Soil contains the ashes of three generations of my people, more it contains the ashes of my own Lambs who are sleeping in the Bosom of their God, and I had rather lay my head on the soil of Carolina in her Defense never to be herd of in History, in Story or in Song, than to go to Virginia and win Laurels to bring Home and lay upon\n[End Page 3]\nthe cinders and ashes of a desolated Home. Let us turn from the sad, sad thoughts of such a blight. Write me a long letter by the Boat, let me hear how you all are, and how you get on with domestic affairs. If we are moved from here I expect it will be to Bulls Bay or perhaps to Charleston, this is only conjecture. I only know this, that our Company will go with the Col where ever he goes, that he will not send us off under any of the other field officers and this is all we ask. I will write you  gain by the first chance Kiss the children for me you see I have written you a long Letter and shall expect one from you equally as long Yours always John R Beaty\n[End Page 4]"
