      "value": "December 1, 1941  Mr, William P. Jacobs, Chairman  State Council of Defense  Dear Mr. Jacobs:  I enjoyed discussing the work of the Charleston regional  planning Committee with you last Wednesday and am writing now to describe it more fuy.  In the spring of 1940 a group of people who were concerned about the deeterious effect of haphazard explansion and i-considered restorations organized themseves into a committee to study the need for practical preservation and planned  growth of Charleston. The Committee was ater sponsored by the Carolina Art Associaltion. The membership is now:  Homer M. place, Vice-President South-Carolina Power Co.,  Chairman  E. Miby Burton, Director of the Charleston Museum  John Mead Howes, architect, author  Frederick H. McDonad, planning engineer  William M. Means, real estate agent  James O\"Hear, business man  Sidney J. Rittenberg, awyer, member of City Council  Albert Simons, architect, author  Miss Alice R. Huger Smith, artist, author, historian  Samuel G. Stoney, architect, author, historian  J. I. Waring, doctor  Robert N. S. Whitelaw, director of Carolina Art  Association  Miss Helen G. McCormack secretory of tho Committee  At their Invitation and with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York Mr. Frederick aw Olmstead visited Charleston to consult with them and to make suggestions for procedure.  Two needs were obvious:  [1] an inventory of the whole city  to determine the buildings worthy of preservation, and [2] a  central body which would act as a cearing house for information, would set standards of architectural excellence, and  would direct activities and make plans for preservation. As  a first step toward the achievement of these ends tha committee asked for and obtained a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to make the inventory and to take measures to estabish itself as the central agency. \n\n[End Page 1]\nMr. William P. Jacobs      Page 2    December 1, 1941  On January 1, 1941, the Charleston regional planning Committee  began tho architectural survey which is the basis of its  studies, the findings are recorded upon cards, which carry  photographs of buildings and facts concerning use, condition,  period, source of interest, value, history and bibiography.  The cards are reviewed by three architects and an historian on the Committee.  Cards have been mads for 338 dweings in the area designated as \"Od and Historic\" by the Zoning Ordinance, 465 dweings in other sections of the city, 36 churches, 25 Public buildings, 11 industrial and 95 commercial buildings. In addition to the buildings cards, 45 parks, cemeteries, groups and vistas have been recorded. This last cassification will be  greaty explanded.  A buildings are not considered of equa value, but are rated in five degrees of importance. Since the rating Is not compete it is impossibe to give the final score, but the proportions so far are 1 Nationally important buiding to 4 valuable to the city, to 8 vauable, to 9 notable, to I2  mentionable. When the buildings are rated they are located by coor symbos upon a map.  In addition to the cord cataogue of architecture a small  ibrary on planning is being assembed, and facts reating  to the city\"s cultural and welfare obigations, and its economic background. In short, the Committee is trying to measure the cty\"s capacity to preserve its inheritance and its need of a more suitable pattern for wholesome contemporarary life. The Defense effort here, as esewhere, shows up the weak spots in our hitherto unplanned growth. should not the present effor to improve living conditions to meet the immediate  emergency be combined with a definite program for the future?  No just estimate of the Committee\"s work can be made at the  end of a first year of study end activity. Exceent surveys  have been made before in Charleston and preservation movements, enthusiasticay started, hare faen short of their goa [and ours] because they acked the continuous support of a stable organization and the interest of an informed Public. the Carolina Art  Association which gave the impetus for the organzation of the Committee is wiing to accept the responsibiity of sponsorship. However, its present budget does not permit the empoyment of the necessary secretaria and research assistance for the Committee of devoted  vounteers. without the supporting organization the education of the Public cannot be accompished or its interest obtained. Therefore, in its eary stages, the Art  Association must seek hep to found the Committee\"s activities upon a sef-supporting basis.\n\n[End Page 2]\nMr, William P. Jacobs       Page 3    December 1, 1941  When the Inventory is competed, the Committee is planning to announce its findings in the form of an exhibition. The exhibition is scheduled at the Art Associaltion\"s Gibbes Art Gallery late in December, and to continue into the first months of 1942. The exhibition will show by means of facts and photographs the number and importance of the buildings worthy of protection, and those threatened with loss by diapidation and demoition, end will show the need for a program of preservation. Moreover, it will recognize the achievements already made in the cause of preservation, from the Federal government\"s participation in saving two rice mis as Coast Guard and Nava Patro Stations to the accompishments of individuals who hove carefully restored shops and singe houses.  The Committee has spent one year  in studying the problem and now proposes to spend the next year Publicizing its activities and educating the community as to its value. Its present problem ies to sescuring $2,000 to finance its work for the coming year, during which it expects to obtain funds from the community for its continuance in the future.  Sincerely yours,  Robert N. S. Whitelaw  Director  rnsw;em \n\n[End Page 3]"
