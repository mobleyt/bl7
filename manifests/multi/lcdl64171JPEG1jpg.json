      "value": "[Richard Henry Lee to [Nathanael Greene]\nOctober 5, 1782\n[RvW Box 2 Folder 42; MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\nDear Sir,\t\tChantilly October the 5th 1782\nI am happy in so good an opportunity\nas Capt. Carne's presents for paying my respects to you,\nwhich I should much oftener do, if safe conveyances\nmore frequently offered. We are here induced to hope\nthat the enemy will leave you nothing more to do in the\nsouth by their evacuation of Charles Town in the course\nof this month. You will then have the glory of commen-\n-cing, prosecuting, and effecting the recovery of a great\npart of this union from the grasp of Tyranny and\noppression. The south must long remember your\nservices and be grateful for them. It is the conjecture\nof many that New York will also be evacuated, but I\nfear that adversity hath not yet sufficiently chastened\nthe Tyrants mind to produce such a total giving up of\nN. America as the quitting N. York would imply. This\nidea seems to be strongly suggested by the parliamentary\ndebates upon the resignation of Mr. Fox, which leaves no\nroom to doubt about the fixt determination not to yield\nthe independence of these States but to the most invincible\nnecessity. The last account from England informs us\nthat the negotiation was still going on, but that little\neffect was expected from it as the King was obstinate \nand\n[End Page 1]\nand had a Ministry to his mind. But tho the King be\nobstinate and has a ministry to his mind, and altho N. York\nbe not speedily quitted, I am much mistaken if the\nnecessity of the case does not soon compel the British\nKing to grin [and] grant independence to America.\nA fine lesson this for Tyrants who may learn from\nhence, that evil deeds may force with convulsive\npangs from the tortured soul, that which it most \nabhors to grant. Gen. Washington is now at the\nhead of 17,000 men well appointed and well\ndisciplined, so that we are in a good posture to\nmeet whatever turn affairs may take.\nAccept, if you please, my best wishes for\nyour health and prosperity, for I am with great\nsincerity and affectionate esteem Sir your most\nobedient [and] very humble Servant\nRichard Henry Lee\n[End Page 2]\n[Endorsed on left margin:] From Rd. [Richard] Henry Lee\nOctr. [October] 5th 1782\n146\n[End Page 3]"
