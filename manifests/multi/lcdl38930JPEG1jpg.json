      "value": "Charleston Mar 14 1866. Mr T. B. Ferguson Dear Sir. Your favor of 12th was recd yesterday. I am sorry to learn that one of the mules has lost his tongue. Has it the appearance of being done recently? or is an affair of some standing? Mr Gillespie may be able to say whether the tongueless mule is of the lot of 6 by the Clark or 8 by the Wenonah and to describe it, so that if the accident occurred before the arrival became ours a reclamation may be made. The wheel is to go up this morning, if no disappointment occurs you will have it tonight. I am just about starting to the R.R. to ship you the Carpenters, if they do not disappoint me. I engaged 4 negro Carpenters yesterday and two white ones, the freemen are to receive two dollars per day and board- one of the latter 2.50, the other $2.00 and board, the reason for the difference in price of the White Carpenters if that the $2 man is only an apprentice. I sent your list for harvest just as you left it and suppose all your order was sent to you Yours &c W. McBurney I have said you will pay daily weekly or monthly. When you wish me to pay give an order [End Page 1] March 14th 66 Wm McBurney 1 O'Mara 2 Clark 3 John Simons 4 Wm Badford 5 John [Coonsome?] 6 Sandy Brown [End Page 2]"
