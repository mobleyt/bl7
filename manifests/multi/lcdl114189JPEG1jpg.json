      "value": "une 10, 1930\n\nDear Miss Bragg:\n\n\tIf I have ever had since the death of my mother a somewhat pathetic feeling of a boy when he leaves his sweet home, it was on last Sunday afternoon. I can not tell you how it is for I want words to describe it. Well what I can say now is that I always bear your motherly picture in my hear wherever I go.\n\n\tI promised to write to you yesterday, but I was too tired because I did not sleep all the night on the train. The actual cause which gave me no time to write to you was that I had to find a room--a very hard task--for myself as I could not and can not stay in our Mission. I spent all yesterday afternoon and forenoon to hunt for a room, but I met a fruitless [2] result. I cold not continue this fruitless work last night because I suppered with Mr. Mei and two Chinese generals who came to the United States only a week ago after their political life had been dead for quite a long while. There were greatly amazed by the prosperouls outlook of the United States and stayed in our Mission until half past eleven when I became too tired and could talk to them no longer.\n\n\tHarvard University gave me a very favorable answer to my application, re--quiring me only one year's residence to finish my Master degree. But I see I must work hard.\n\n\tRegarding my friend, she has definitely turned out a girl I do not want to marry. This is all that I can say of here. I must mind my own future and my own work now. I am still tired and must stop.\n\n\tYours affectionately, \n\n\tFong Lee\n[3]\n[P.S.] This whole morning was also spent in finding a room. Just when I began to think of going to Cambridge, Mass. I succeeded in getting a room This was at twelve o'clock. Now I have all my things moved to this room and plan to stay until it is the time for me to to to Harvard Summer School. F.L.\n\n[From:] F.L. Wong\n2032 I Street, N.W.\nWashington, D.C.\n\n[Address:] Miss Laura M. Bragg\n38 Chalmers Street\nCharleston, S.c."
