      "value": "White Oak Dec 30 [illegible due to water damage]\nDear Sister,\nI thank you for your letter which [illegible due to water damage] one from Ann, has contributed to our evenings amusement. I assure you we have sense had more to enliven us than yourselves-- for though we had many bows and courtesies made us, they were only from our domestics, in return for the presents of the season. Peter came up in the rain on friday, having been detained by the boat and returned again on monday morning. Charles brought his little girls to see us the first fine day, which was but the last satur-day[sic]; they are all fat and blooming.\nI hope we may see you in town when we return, for our winters are not very severe and a great part of this has already past. The cold that Ann is encountering is something more -- Mani begins to fear it [and] on the day her letter was written, begged her to take her walk without him, he would wait for a warmer day- when he does go, he sets his collar straight up, which nearly reaches the top of his hat, and wraps his arm carefully in his cloak. She describes Miss\n[end of page one]\n[illegible due to water damage] it-- first a large shawl, then a cloak completely lined with fur, and then boa of some yards, wound several times around her throat. Mr. Taylor minds it more than herself, and exclaims, \"Oh it is so furiously Bold\" She mentions having been invited to a wedding amongst the rich of the land, but did not go; the Bride was dressed in Brussels Lace, and the gown alone cost $500. A wrought woven basket was presented by the Bride Groom, with articles for the toilet, and sets of jewelry, valued at $10,000 and the entertainment was on the same scale.   \nMiss Ogden while making a visit mentioned something of an engagement of Emma Huger's, about which her Aunt Mrs. M. writes very mysteriously; may tell me all about it- is it W. Middleton? F. Huger?-- or perhaps a son of Madame Cararait--.\nI hope Ben has been careful to give you an abundant supply of wood; the cellar keys were not left with him, but it might have occurred to him to open the door of the bathing room which was nailed up on the outside, if it has not, pray desire him to open it. \nWe propose seeing Mrs. Hume tomorrow, Mrs.\n[end of page two]\nJ. Hume [illegible due to water damage] I was the editor of the Mevemory [illegible due to water damage] Gibbes. I suppose you have mead [illegible due to water damage] the Ealipse in the same. My love to [illegible due to water damage], Louisa, and believe me dear sister, Yours [illegible due to water damage]\nC. [Manigault?]\n[PS] Ann desires her love to you, and [illegible due to water damage] her I am afraid to write to her, lest I should get enough in my letter to please her.\"\n[end of page three]\n[written in the center of the paper vertically]\nMiss H.A. Drayton\nCharleston\n[end of page four]"
