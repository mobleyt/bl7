      "value": "Combahee Jan 1st. 1851    Dear Sir  I have been commissioned by my Grfather, who is himself prevented by indisposition and infirmity, to reply to your letter of the 21st Dec. He directs me to state, that he has a settled disinclination to invest his property in the way you propose, and that nothing but a strong desire to do what is agreeable to one, with whom he has so long been associated, could induce to depart from that policy now. The securities you offer with the Bond are ample and undoubted. Upon presenting the same at the Office [Messrs?] Jas. H. Ladson & Co., property executed, it will accepted by them. This letter will be sufficient to authorize to do so and to transfer to your order the amount called for, viz Two thousand, six hundred dollars $2600. My Grfather directs me to add, that it would be most agreeable to him for you to carry out the design mentioned in your postscript, and make the transference to other hand at as early a period as convenient  Very Respectfully  Your O.B.S.T.  Jas. B. Heyward    Frances D. Quath Esq. [End Page 1] Francis D. Quash Esq. [End Page 2]"
