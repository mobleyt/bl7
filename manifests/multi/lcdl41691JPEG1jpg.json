      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent Columbia S.C. April 28th /60 My dearest Brother, I am happy to hear through John that you are quite well. I suppose Anna has returned home, and your busy season of \"convention\" is nearly over. We had a visit or rather visitation from the \"Counsel from Belgium\" who spoke of you, & entertained us in company with Rev Father Joseph with beautiful descriptions of the churches of St Sophia & the Cathedral of Cologne. He begged [Written on margin]: all else must yield - therefore we trust that God will bless our efforts & give us the means of glorifying His holy name. I wrote to Sr Antonia a few days since begging their prayers for our success. I understand we shall get some pupils next year from the College who are dissatisfied. We all write in begging your benediction & prayers especially your own sister Ellen Sr Baptiste What do you think of Sr M (illegible) reception being published in the Miscellany?[End Page 1] me to present his compliments & say that he ran away from the turmoil of politics. I could understand very well what he said, but Sr Augustin was my interpretress - he seemed much pleased with his visit, if we may judge by its length & his manner. But that is nothing, for yesterday Sr Johanna (wed) received the Richmond Dispatch, with an article on Columbia, written by Mr. Baldwin the lecturer, in which he mentions not a word of our institution, which is probably the only one he visited & which he seemed so much pleased with. So goes the popularity-seeking world! How happy a thing it is for us, that we[End Page 2] seek out approbation & reward in so different a source! Thank God for all His blessings to us & they are innumerable. John told you I suppose that Revd Father Murphy brought Miss Jerrale (?) of Halifax as a boarder - her father had written to you about her - he paid us $150.00. She is fifteen years of age & a very nice girl. Mr Ambler Weed says that Bp McGill has recd Sr J_ 's letter, & speaks with pleasure of officiating at her reception but will not be able to leave until after or about the feast of the Ascension {will you write to him also please}. Some of the Elite of Columbia have expressed a wish to witness such a[End Page 3] ceremony - so I suppose it will be A.M.D.G. to have it as before, open to strangers. We will miss the black veils of the Srs of Mercy in the procession - they wrote to me on their arrival home. We will try & move the pianos together next week, to have the children learn to play in concert for the exhibition. We shall be obliged to take the front room adjoining the chapel for them - it is the only one we have large enough excepting our refectory - so we must find another for the teaching of embroidery. I intend to take Sr (illegible) day school for that, as it is more roomy for the frames than any others - but I must get a carpenter to let the windows down from the top - for it is very close & we cannot of course open them from below. I dread all the expenses necessary for the arrangements for distribution - it will be equal to those of Brown County or more. However, it is not for personal enjoyment but for our Institute, to which the rule says[End Page 4]"
