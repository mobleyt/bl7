Miss Posi goes down tomorrow, with Mr. Woodward & family, to spend Holy Week, and Mother desires me to write by her, & ask if you can spare any of the blue satinet, that you let Brothers John & her Francis have some of for Father who is sorely in need of an overcoat & is so well pleased with[End Page 1] Brother Francis's suit that he would like to have one like it. I hope you're quite well & enjoyed your visit. I suppose we may expect you soon after Easter. Mother has much up her mind & is making preparation to accompany you on your foreign trip as you once promised her she could do, & is anxiously awaiting your answer. When you come up, of course, we have never spoken of it, to any one. We understand there was an explosion at the arsenal yesterday, killing some and wounding many & would like to know if Mr. Laughlin is hurt. His wife has heard nothing of it yet. This is the anniversary of poor Brother Hugh's death. It appears as an event of yesterday, in its sad effects desolating heart & home. Father, Mother & all join in much love. Love to you my dear Brother & hope you will come up soon. Pray for your affectionate sister. Anna[End Page 2]"
