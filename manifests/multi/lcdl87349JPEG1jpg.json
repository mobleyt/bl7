      "value": "Ordnance Office\nCharleston, Oct. 5, 1861\nHis Excellency\nGov. F. W. Pickens\nColumbia, S. C.\n\nSir\nGenl. W. G. DeSaussure, Secretary of Treasury Executive Department, has requested me to sign an Order which he brought to me, countersigned by yourself, to the Treasurer of the Lower Division, to deliver to Thomas R. Waring, Esq. Cashier Bank of State of So. Ca., the One Thousand five hundred certificates required to be issued by him under an Act entitled \"An Act for the establishment of a Coast Police for the State of South Carolina.\" - The object of Genl DeSaussure being to deposit said Certificates, as Collateral Security, in the Bank of the State, upon which an advance might be made by the Bank. -\nThe Act referred to makes the Sum of One hundred and Fifty thousand Dollars in the Treasury of the State subject to the Draft of the Ordnance Officer, countersigned by the Governor, the same to be employed for the purposes specified. But it does not, so far as I can perceive, give to the parties named, the control of the Certificates themselves; which are simply the means or instruments, by which the amount is to be raised. - I therefore respectfully suggest that, if Your Excellency needs the amount, you will send me the Draft for the amount\n[page 2]\nof One Hundred and fifty thousand Dollars appropriated under the act referred to; which I will sign at Your request; and then the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the Lower Division, and the Bank of the State, may take such measures as they may deem proper to realize the amount (the same not being at present in the Treasury)\nBy the terms of the Act, the Draft of the Ordnance Officer is necessary to procure the money, but he is neither charged with the disbursement of the same, nor the accounting for it; the Governor having full charge of the said fund. - Upon Your Excellency's notifying me to that effect I will therefore readily give the Draft you require. - But it is the opinion of the Attorney General, whom I have consulted as to the extent of my responsibility in the matter, that such a notification from Your Excellency should be given me in writing. - Accordingly, I have the honor to request that Your Excellency will sign the enclosed form, and send the same, together with a Draft for One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars, countersigned by yourself, to Genl. DeSaussure. - Upon his handing the same to me I will immediately sign the Draft and return it to him, to be disposed of as Your Excellency deems proper. \nVery Respectfully\nYour Obed. Sevt.\nEdward Manigault\nCol. Ordnance. -\n[page 3, said enclosed form]\nColumbia\n7. Oct. 1861\nTo Col. Ed. Manigault - Ordnance officer\nSir\nI enclose a Draft for One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) on the Treasurer of the Lower Division, countersigned by myself, which the Ordnance Officer will please sign; as the Amount is needed for the purposes specified and provided for, under the 1st and 2nd Sections of an Act entitled \"An Act for the establishment of a Coast Police for the State of South Carolina.\" - \nAfter signature the Draft will be returned to Genl. W. G. DeSaussure, Secretary of Treasury Executive Department. - \n[in light pencil]\n(Signed) F. W. Pickens\n[page 4, back of page 1]\nCol. Manigault\nOrdnance officer\nwith a draft -\nfor $150,000 - and\nthe reason why it \nis to be signed\n7. Oct. 1861"
