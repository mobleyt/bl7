[General]\nI am honored with Your agreeable\nfav - 1st Ultimo for which You have my thanks.\nNothing is more flattering than the prospect now\nbefore us, and I trust a few Months more will put\nan End to our Military troubles, I am sure there\nis not a Circumstance in life that would afford me\nso much Satisfaction, and I think I can answer\nfor the rest of Our Brother Officers who have shared\nwith us in Adversity, and have now nothing to re-\n-tire on but light hearth, and thin Breaches.\nhowever the reflection of Independence compen-\n-sates for every thing and I hope none will give\nground till that is happily accomplished. –\nI am fully apprised how necessary it is\nfor us to be jealous of every ministerial measure,\nGiving up the American Sun, is a bitter Pill\nto them but is must be Swallowed, in the mean\ntime Wisdom tells us to Continue the watch [and]\nnot to be deluded by British Chicanerie [sic], they \nwill try every Intelligence however I hope it is\nnow too late, Our Alliances strengthen us their\ntheir power diminishes.\nThe Evacuation of Charles Town I had\nset down as on the 1st. of October, the measure\nI was sure would take place this fall, For\nwhen the commons confess “That the Reble [sic]\nGenl. [General] Green[e] had so changed the face of war\nin that Quarter, that it now became a con-\n-sideration of a future day”, What other\n[End Page 1]\nIdea could an Enthusiast have, who has ever\nconceived himself inspired with a true knowledge\nof the Event of your Operations? –\nThe Refugees I consider as an offspring of\nMiltons fallen Tribe – I fancy however they\nwant a Moloch to stand up and afford conso-\n-lation by New projects in War. They like\ntheir Breathern [sic] are kicked out of the land of\nBliss, let them now Grovell [sic] in dirst [dirt] for past\noffences, I pitty [sic] them not. –\nNew York is not as Yet Evacuated\nnor do I think it will shortly, perhaps they\nmay draw their forces to that point for a time\nwith a Vein to serve as an object in negotiations.\nYour wishes being compleat [sic] affords Your\nFriends no small satisfaction, Our knowledge\nof each other makes me thus free in language\nAnd may I assure You my dear General, no\nperiod in this war more interested my feelings\nthan that in which You Assumed the Deranged\nand desperate command of the Southern\nDepartment, and I bless my Stars for my\nFriends success, return now with laurels\nYou ware [wear] them justly. –\nYou cant conceive how happy You\nhave made my little Family by informing\nMrs Green[e] keeps her health. Mrs Weedon bids\nme tell You boath [sic], she will have plentiful\nDishes served up with frollicks for Your re-\n-ception, I wish You would hurry on and\nspend the Winter with us, for notwithstanding\nYou have have been so Accustomed of late\n[End Page 2]\nto reducing  Posts, be assured the two Gunner\nRedoubt[s] in Fredericksburg, will from Inclination\ngive You a warm reception, - I shall lay in \nPlentiful Magazines of Hogg meat [and] Homoney [sic], \nPeach [and] Rye Liqr therefore advance whenever\nYou please. -   Washington [and] Lee have secured \nfor themselves Admirable Quarters. It gives me\nthe highest satisfaction to hear of a Continental's \nsitting down with a plentiful supply of corn,\nwine, [and] Oil, The latter of those Gentlemen has\nbeen busy in making his Domistick Arrangements,\nand has Pitched his Tent at Stratford in the\nNorthward Neck, about 20 miles from hence.\nI shall tell him of his neglect the first time I see\nhim.      Be so obliging as to present my respect\nto Burnett, let him know Mr. Burnman [?] has recd.\nthe letters he inclosed under Cover of his last fav.r\nAnd I have this moment an Oportunity [sic] of sending\nhim his second.  Katty joines [sic] me to love to\nyou and lady, Believe me\nYours affectionately\nG [George] Weedon \n[End Page 3]\n[Endorsed:]  General Weeden [Weedon]\nNov [November] 6th 1782\n[?]           X\n146\n[End Page 4]"
