      "value": "August 18, 1945\nGertie Darling\nI wrote you a hurried line yesterday about general affairs and\nthis morning I want to give you a few thoughts that I have on the future. It\nappears that I can get out of the navy out here if I wish to. This would immediately\nmake me a civilian and then you could cone out without any trouble. Providing of\ncourse that there is transportation. Truman said that there were more ships in the\nPacific than they knew what to do with so that tranportation may not be as difficult\nas it first seems. The other thing would be for me to get out of the Navy back on\nthe mainland.\nThe advantages of getting out here would be that you could come out\nand see what you think of the place. We could decorate the shop and give Gerry a hand\nas she is absolutely swa[m]ped right now, and then in the latter part of November we could\ngo back to [T]he states shoot at Medway and go onto Florida for the bad weather. In this \nway we could have  a pretty good idea by Spring what we think of the various places\nand would be better off in knowledge when it cones to comparing advantages and disadvantg\nIf I decide to get out of the Navy back on the mainland I will have to awaitx\nmy orders to the mainland and transportation there. The latter will cause\ndelay because the traffic is all one way back to the Mainaland. Of course there are\nso many things that will come up within the next two or three days that [perhaps] my decison\nwill be made for me.\nI an enclosing a copy of a letter from Knoth relative to timbering\nthe plantation. I an still in favxxing of doing this rather than renting it ,\nI think becaux se we will always be timbering as a steady source of inca\nme to support the place while if we rent it we will not be able to use\nit ourselves. It would be fun to shoot it this winter due to the fac[t]\nthat is has[sh]ot been shot for three years and should provide very good sp\nsport.\nThis machine isgiving me the Jitters. I think it has the [\"]war over bug[\"]\nand does nothing it is supposed to. It is not my own but one in my new\noffice and I am at its mercy. Have played tennis with Morris and\nsome of the men at the club several times since my return andplayed very\nbadly. We have been beaten each time, and buble belley says that is\nbecause I went to school and tried to use my brain instead of my body.\n[End Page 1]\nMy first kmpression of this place was that the Ala Wai lo_oked like a\nrather shabb_y southern town. That thepalms were stunted and wind blown\nand that the people were second rate. However after a [f]ew deys my eyes have\nbecome accoustosed to it all and I again think it is attractive and that\nthe clim[T]e is marvellous. The water is so warm that you can play\npurpoise in it for ever and never be cold. The sun is so strong that\nin one day on the beach I became as black as an indian. However Waikiki\nbeech is second rate. The water is not clear, the beach is not attractive\nand the people lying around maybe alright in war time but not in peace.\nMany of the people that I knew like Mr and Mr Bradshaw are going to back to\nthe mainland because they say that they do not think there will be anyone\nhere after the war. However they of course are not taking into account\nthe peop_le who have always lived here.\nHenry DeGore the manager of the Outrigger has left for Frisco because\nhe says that there are no schools that are worth a dam for his children and\nthat he would not bring them up here with all the orientals. There are all\nthese things to consider and I think that the next few months will be in\na constant state of flux and that the islands will not really adjust thems -\nelves for perhaps a yeer. Big plans are on foot for the erection of a\nhotel on Mauix by the Matson line. They are going to have x tennis\ncourts riding and golf. Fifty rooms very attractive right on the sea\nwith palm[s]and all sorts of tropical sorroundings. The reason for this\nis that they say they realizie that Honlulu has lost the charm of its\nhawaiian atmosphere and that some other place must take it up if tourists\nare to come. I think they are right because Waikiki is not the sort of\nplace that you can say how lovely , just like the south seas.\nThis afxt[e]rrnoon I an going to see the man in charge of tranpo\nrtation for civilians an_d also the man who has control of Navy wives\ncomming out. Will write and let you know what is happening. Bet you are\none jump ahead of a fit wondering what we are going to do and when we are\ngoingto do it. Just remember that I love you the most in the world and \nthat it is almost all over and if you will just have a little more\npatience everything will come out alright and these years will be just\na dream to be forgotten or talked about xxx because they were so extra\nordinary.\nGood bye darling.\nSidney\nSidney\n[End Page 2]\n[enclosed]\nROBERT F. KNOTH [and] CO.\nForesters - Appraisers - Surveyors\n39 Broad Street\nCharleston 3, S. C.\nAugust 11, 1945\nMr. Sidney J. Legendre,\nP.O.Box 166,\nNavy No. 128,\nFleet Post Office, San Francisco, Cal.\nDear Mr. Legendre:\nI have, via Mr. Lowndes, your letter to him of the 3rd.\nFirst I must say that I am glad to heard you and Mrs. Legendre are both alive,\nand I presume kicking, and possibly back in the states.\nMonday, unless it is V-J day I am going to run over Medway to refresh my\nmind on the timber and if not Monday the first day possible this week. Upon\nreviewing the cutting plan we worked up for Medway I not that it would\nbe possible to operate this tract on a three year basis taking off about\n1,000,000' - 1,500,000' B.M.-Part of this cut being made up of pole-piling\ntimber, the remainder from sawtimber.-I know exactly how you want the operation\nhandled. The above volume is conservative and totals about 65-70[percent] of the\ngrowth made in the years since 1942 or in other words the past 3 years, thus\nthe original forest capital has not only remained intact, but will, even after\nremoving 1,500,000', be increased by 770,000' to approximately 13,500,000'.\nUpon looking the tract over I will report to you my recommendations. It\nwill be about 8 weeks before we can do any actual timber marking, however as\nI have to run down to Alabama for the Ewing Estate on a timber cruise\nwhich will take that long. [The Ewing's incidently make Carpets or something\nin New York and perhaps Mrs. Legendre knows them] In any even I do not \nrecommend cutting before fall as this cuts down pine beetle damage to the\nremaining trees, the beetle being very active in summer timber operations and\nfrequently killing trees that have been inavoidably scarred during logging\noperations.\nOur service charges are 10[percent] of the gross stumpage returns as I informed you\nonce on the Plantation. This fee is not exorbitant and in fact is very reasonable\ntaking into consideration that we select and mark the timber to be felled,\ntally its volume,draw up the timber sale contracts, enforce the contract \nrequirements,[by weekly field inspections, obtain responsible purchasers and\nmost important obtain the prevailing market price or better, see that the\n[End Page 3]\n[enclosed]\n2. Contd.\nmoney is paid and that you have honest and efficient service. Attention\nto road damage of course would be covered in the timber sale inspections\nand supervision as the operation progresses.\nI might call to your attention that the collecting and burning o tops is\na little on the impractical side and unless you have some special reason\nfor this practice I would recommend its abandonment for the practice we have\nfound best suited to the lowcountry, i.e. lopping the remaining tops so that\nno more than two feet of the top lies above the ground surface. This eliminates\nserious bug damage, makes it easy to shoot over the tops, satisfys the aesthetic\nviews of the owner and does not interfere with cattle grazing. Such lopped\ntops being in close contact with the ground completely rot in a matter of\na two to three year period. An area logged in this fashion looks not unlike\nan unlogged area from 200 feet or so.\nIf the operator desires to place a ground mill on the tract we will choose\nthe point for him and make certain that the sawdust pile is so handles that\nit can be readily burnt and the area cleaned up so that no signs will be left\nafter three or so years. The site to be in a back area where it will become\nno eyesore while in operation.\nAs stated above I fully appreciate the way you want this timber cut, and from\npersonal angle I want to do the job from the best possible forestry standpoint\njust to prove to Mr. Richardson that he is a DF in cutting all his timber at\none time against my recommendations, and also for the future business a good\nforestry job will bring in.\nWe are also going to handle similar operations on Mr. H. B. Hollins 'Braodmarsh'\nPlantation and Mrs. D. R. Noyes, 'Dawn Plantation' this winter.\nSincerely yours,\n--\nRobert F. Knoth\n[End Page 4]"
