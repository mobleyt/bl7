  "description": "Caricature by Emil Flohri published in Judge. The associated text reads : \"The convention and fair which the federation of Jewish farmers held recently in New York, at the Educational Alliance, demonstrated that the Jew's entrance into the agricultural field has been marked by signal success. Ten years ago there were, perhaps, less than a hundred Jewish farmers scattered across the country. They produced no more than the bare rations of subsistence, living each day from hand to mouth, and trusting to the good graces of fortune for their continued support rather than to their own knowledge of the rules of farming. Today there are more than five thousand of them in the United States alone. The European figures run into tens of thousands. Each year this number increases. Men and women from the Ghettos of the big cities are beginning to appreciate the advantages of the independence of the farmer's life. They see that they can make a better living at agriculture than at their present occupations. They are combining with an increased knowledge of scientific farming a desire to succeed at this, their first productive venture.\"",
