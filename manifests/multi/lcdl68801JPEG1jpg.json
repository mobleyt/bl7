      "value": "67\nFeb 17th '43\nDear Sidhye ,\nThe air mail must be improving because you received my letter of th e\n_ sixth onfthe Ilth. I received your IIth on the I7th. I cant make out whether you\nskipped one of my letters or not.I dont know what happened to my 62 unless I numberd\nit wrong. You forgot to number your last one of the II th.\nYour dinner at the Moody's sounds wonderful. You say \"I wonder how\nmuch people do become alike when they are together.We are told over and over again\nhow alike we are etc Perhaps it will improve me who knows\". Please dont become\nlike anything but yourself.I like the way ou are- not how Morris is but_y2u  Sidney.\nMorris' exagerations are alright for Morris,but Sweetheart stay just the way you\nare and dont imitate him.One is so apt to be swamped by a stronger character, older ,\nbrother or what have you, but I remember when we get married and you broke away\nfrom Morris you were much more of a person. Morris sort of domaneered the situat ion\nand was the Boss before that time- do you sort of remember what I mean? You two'\nare a heavenly pair, but yourself and dont follow along all the time. Maybe you\nthink I am cr azy to say such a thing but I dont mean anything at all against Morris\nwhom.I adore, not at all,so dont think I am chritlsizing hime I'm not. I\nguess I just love you for the way you are and dont want anybody to change you.\nThat doodles at the party sounded lovely and I am surprised he_d1d '\nn't make freinds with you at once. l thought dogs always could tell who loved\nthem.mostest. My spanial has n t yet been sent back to the kennel but 1 am afraid\nhe must go. I have been trying\"to sell him here in \"ashington to somebody but with -\nno success. He has improved alot but not enough, and 1 am afraid he will always\nbe nervous and frightened.\nYou forgot to give me your apartment address whnch I want very muc-h\nto have in case I turn up. I am so delighted it is O.K. by you,as I would not ha-ve\nwanted to upset you with the Navy people. New I feel free to bend every effort to\nget there. I wish you would make clearer the matter of Gunnery school and why\nkorris has gone there. I trust it has nothing to do with a thought in your mind - _\nof making a transfer to a ship; ? Please enlighten me as I feel that if Morris made\nthat move you would also??\nDid you get my letter telling you how my India trip fell through?\nI might in time get sent elsewhere if 1 stuck around here but it is all so nebulous\nand uncertain. I have an idea 1 may get no answer on this asslgnement to Hawaii\nuntil Warren Delano returns. 1hey may be waiting to see what he has to say about `\nit. Thats my guess anyway. In the mean time 1 have my fingers crossed and have a\nbpg HOPE in my heart of seeing you soon. Its almost unbelievable its so exciting.\nI am looking forwardito seeing Lester and only hope you gave him my address or\ntelephone number as want so much to hear al about you.\nEllen is crazy to get me to take a week off and go to Florida with\n[End Page 1]\n2\nher and lie on a beach. I am so crazy and even tempted to do it but dont know that\nI should ask for such a trip at this time when_I am working on my trip to you,\nand at the same time have taken on the new respensability of runping the whole cable\ndesk with 4 workers under me. My salary has jumped up again_and I am now almost\nmaking as much as that Expensive overseer we had at Medway-1've forgotten his name-\nPlattll Its much more fun being one's own boss than having a figgure-head over one. _\nI believe the two of'us would do well in this kind of business together. I believe\nwe are getting the same kind of training- but I cant quite see what it is going to\nfit us for. Alot of it is like a treasure hunt to deduct from the clew what the -\nperson is driving at. I'm getting positively a stmh sense about 1t,and find 1 ca n\nalmost lay my hands on it when they strt to open their mouthsw to ask. _\n1 had a battle with a civil service man who rates Civil Service workers.lt all\nhappened because I wanted a raise for my very smart bright little secretary. I had\na hard tbme convincing him how much sense it took to carry out the job here.How you\nhad to be Houdini or a seer to know what people we e driving at,an d to know the\nanswers, what they want, and adapt yourself to daigy Huw rules and new ideas. I -\ncertainly Qled to give him a picture of terrific mental giants at work 9 hours of\nthe day but 1 shall be pleasantly surprided if he places her in the next catagor y\nas he is anxious to keep everything as 1s,and hold everything to the minimu . A tough\nnut to crack I thought.\nThe\"Charkie Hardie\"you speak of whose shins I blacked was Charlie Harding\nour freind on the fishing`tr1p in Cuba. You remember him. Very pleasant guy whom\nyou liked. In fact the only bright spot of that fishing trip till he went home f_or\na funeral or something.\ncooler where the cadavres are placed on lee. t must have been wonderful fun.\nI have n't danced for so long I am sure I have forgotten how. Have you learned th e\nhula yet? 1 bet you will be as nimble at it as a native by the time you leave th.e\nisland. I hope you will be able to sing me all the Haw1ian.mus1c.1ou should practice\nup on a guitar. It would be tops. I love those tunes so,and would so love to sit\nand listen to that music with you in the moonlight. My I hope 1 can. We would cer-\ntalnly hold hands,and k1ss,and huggle,and it would be lovely my darling to be with l\nyouand look at the moonlight on the water together. I.th1nk of it so much.\nNow that you are alone in the apartment E wonder whether you are doing\nthe cooking,or eat all your meals at the Outrigger. I wish I was'there to putter\nwith you and scramble eggs.My only claim to cooking. maybe you're a wiz now, and\nwhen you get home will make all sorts of delicious dishes. Our dinners consist o-f \nwhatever the market_has, its no longer a question of what you want-its what you\ncan get. I must say it does n t really bother me- not as yet anyway.\nIs Mrs Hoody's house attractive? Has it a patio? a garden? you havffe\nnever mentioned flowers out there and always think of them more than an thing in n\nconnection with Honolulu. My we neveled in them. How delicious those leys-you used \"\nto smell hanging on the back of a chair even after wearing them all night. Do you n\ndress in your white uniforms much? You always lookeQ so snappy in them.I liked them y\nbestest. Where are those photos? I know I am bothering you to death about them.but\nwant to see you so much. Its so long since 1 really saw you.\nI do hope this letter will go to you air mail and that you will g et\nit by the 22nd. \nIsuppose without Morris in the apartment you feel sort of lonely?\nLots and lots of love my darling. Write me as often as you can . I\nlive for them. \nHoping to see you soon and that if get there you will be there for\nthe duration, an t t you have no other plans.\nAll my love- Gertie\n[End Page 2]"
