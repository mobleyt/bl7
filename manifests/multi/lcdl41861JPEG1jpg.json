      "value": "Combreé the 6th November 1863 My dear Parents, In the letter which I addressed you by the rev. Mr. Flynn, whom as I learn has not been able to arrive at Columbia and who is now in Baltimore, I spoke to you rightly and plainly on a subject on which depends not only my happiness on the earth but also my future life, my vocation. Perhaps you will be surprised, my dear Parents, for your have always thought that I would certainly be a priest, but you counted too steadfastly on a resolution that had been formed in me, before I had gained the age of reflection and of studying to see if really it was my vocation to be a priest or not. This age has come, and the moment itself [?] has arrived. Placed in an eclesiasticle [ecclesiastical] college since five years, kept by priests, I have been able to study all the qualities necessaries for this holy state, as all so [also] the thousand dangers for one who embraces it with out the qualities necessaries. Perhaps if I would say to you all of a sudden \"I do not want to be a priest\" you could ask me with justice why so, and if I could not give you creditables [sic] reasons perhaps you would be irritable justly, but when I tell you that, arrived at an age where man commences to think for himself, ad to reason fro it and against, when I tell you that I have weighed the qualities necessaries to make a good priest I and also my defaults, and that I find that I am not fit to make a priest, you cannot, I think, my dear Parents, feel any ressentment [sic] and blame me for it, for although this news may hurt you and fully, yet I am sure that you would be happier to hear [MS damaged] than to hear that I had condemned my[End Page 1] self to be unhappy in this life and likely in the next and why? for fear of speaking plainly to you and telling you that if I am a priest it is not because it is my vocation but because you wish it. And certainly this would be the case with me, for I feel something in the bottom of my heart that warns me that if I would wish to be a priest, I would fall in the road wrong. To speak to you plainly my dear Parents, I ought never to have come to France; I am there five years, I have staid [sic] there five years too long. Now, my dear Parents, let me beg of you one thing: that is to abstain from all persuasion. the avowal that I have just made has made my heart bleed, what will it be if I will be obliged to refuse you something, you my parents whom I love so dearly? No, as it is not my vocation to be a priest, Almighty God will give me the force and courage to help my father who has made so many sacrifices to give me a good education. Another thing: if the bishop has paid any-thing for me with the money of the diocess [dioceses], I wish to repay every thing back again, as it is but just. Perhaps you will ask me what state of life I would wish to embrace then? My dear parents, the question is not hard to answer. In finding myself in South Carolina at the end of the war with a little money I could gain a good deal in the cotton trade; but we will talk all this over when I will have the happinesse [sic] of seeing you which will be soon I hope. As my classes are finished I would like[End Page 2] to leave France as soon as possible; not later than the month of May if possible, if the war is not yet finished at this time I would like to leave any way, being able to go to Canada or Nassau where I would certainly find a place until the end of the war, especially in the first country, and once the war finished I would return immediately to Columbia. I hope you will not refuse to acceed [accede] to my desires my dear Parents, for every day my desire of seeing you increases and my dislike of the Frenchmen likewise, and it will be astonishing if we can keep well together until I receive a letter from you telling me to leave. I hope the letter will not be long coming for the quicker the better for me. I will look for an answer to my letter until the month of September next, if it is not then arrived I will gain America as best I can for I do not know if the superior would wish to give me the money without your ordering it but your going to America there is more than one way. My dear Parents, you cannot imagine all that I have suffered during the war; my greatest wish was to go to America, and certainly if I could have been free I would have done so, but the Supérieur just told me what he would do if I wished to leave against his will so as I was not of age I had to keep quiet[End Page 3] I exspect [sic] my dear Parents that by all that I have told you in this letter, that you understand my position in France at present and that you will write as soon as possible letting me telling me to leave immediately. During the time that the letter will take to come I will try and keep on good terms with the Frenchmen. My dear Parents, I do not know what Uncle Patrick will think, but you understand that he cannot be angry with me and that he would be perfectly wrong in trying to persuade me to act against my vocation which he will certainly do if he wished me still to be a priest. I write him a letter in the same time as I write yours. Now, my dear Parents, I finish my letter begging of you to write as soon as possible, at the latest for the month of May and sooner if the war is finished. For fear that this letter will not reach you I will waite [sic] a little later in sending the letter to Mr. Lafitte as my dear Father advised me to do. Kiss my dear brothers and Sisters for me, and tell them that I hope to see them soon, and the two little ones for the first time. Send my love to Aunt Louisa, tell her that I will write soon, also to Aunt Ellen. Kiss grandfather and grandmother for me when you will see them, and pray for your affectionate son. Robert Lynch[End Page 4]"
