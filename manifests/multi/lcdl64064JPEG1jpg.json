The instruction to Ladson [and] Co. will shortly go forth, and the addition of 250$ to the quarterly remittance, \"to each\", making $1000 will be made at the usual time. This is not done without a reprimand for extravagance. The law is- sin not at all! - Make no debts, and you will make an honorable retreat. The practice of debt will make it familiar, an addition of an 0 may win you, and cause you to be an involuntary abolitionist Let this be avoided my steady habits, with a resolution to deny yourself luxuries, until you have provided resources by professional wit.-Your creditors may now be refreshed with the joyful information that your bills will be paid at your next quarterly remittance, counting from Chal.ton 1 Ap.prox. I suppose my gSon Nathaniel in close correspondence with on the subject of his expenses. He has bought a large house in Beaufort. He is building a lofty one at White hall- And is soon to take a wife to his own House! [End Page 1] When this is done, the house is to be furnished and sustained. This is taken from the profits of the Estate, and makes him accountable to others for their dividends. Upon your return to Carolina in Oct- being of age [21]- I shall resign my Administration, and leave you with the rice crop to make your own arrangements and work for yourselves. Our steady habits at Combahee leave me nothing to communicate, but the comfort and health and profound tranquility notwithstanding the growls of the Abolitionist - I am Yrs. very Affect.ly and Truly Nathl.
