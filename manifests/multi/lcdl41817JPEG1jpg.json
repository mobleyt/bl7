      "value": "A.M.D.G. Ursuline Convent Columbia S.C. Feb 5th /63 My dearest Brother, We have been thrown into some excitement by the intended departure of the British Consul, which looks very ominous & as if the war were coming home to us. Still we pray that our Blessed Mother may intercede on our behalf -- & frustrate the designs of the enemy. What saint & Bishop was it that when called on in a time of war to curse the enemy refused to do so, but went up on an eminence, & lifted up his hands towards heaven & over towards the enemy, & prayed that our Lord would send such a quantity of gnats as would put them into confusion. When immediately his prayer was heard, & the gnats filled the nostrils of horses & elephants to such a degree, that they became restive, throwing their riders & defeating the enemy! Can you not do something like that for Charleston? What will become[End Page 1] of the Sisters & orphans? Will they go to Sumter, Summerville of here? Mr Bernard ONeill placed his little daughter here as a boarder Feb 3rd & was too bashful to propose payment of the bill -- I will send it today however. If the weather had not been so severe we would have expected you yesterday or today, but we have not had such snowy, sleety rainy cold weather since we came to Columbia. The feast of the Purification was quite a joyous day with us -- twenty of the children approached Holy Communion on that day & we had the church music was good - notwithstanding the hard times we had candles. I begin to feel now that our payments for the new session are coming in, that we have too much money doing nothing, & it would be better to fund it in some way that you would advise. Shall we buy another mortgage on this house or buy Isaac (!) or put it in the savings Bank? Should this currency ever become worthless (which God forbid) would not all in bank be useless to us, & as if we had none? If so, it would be better to purchase property. If you like we will buy a mortgage on the Keitt place? or whatever you advise. I have not seen John today -- he suffers a good deal from his chest. Our sisters too are complaining more than usual -- two of them having been confined to their rooms -- I suppose it the cold & changeable weather. Pray for your own sister[End Page 2]"
