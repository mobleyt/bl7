      "value": "J.M.J. Ursuline Convent. Columbia, S.C. March 14th 1862. My dearest Brother This is the second day this week that I have gone to Holy Communion for you on your birth-day the 10th; & today, the Anniversary of your consecration-- Well, what is your experience of having worn the mitre four Years--. Do you say like good Bishop Wood-- that is no easy thing--? How much has transpired since your Consecration! And now you are almost like one beginning, except that you have before you in eternity, treasures I trust stored up-- For myself, who am nearly as long Superior-- while I sometimes grow weary, very weary & almost tired out, I arouse myself & renew my first beginnings & fervor, with the thought of God's great goodness to me, in placing me in a position where I can labor more for Him, & for my own sanctification, than so many others can-- And as one of our Lay-[End Page 1] Sisters said, when the [body?] is tired, the soul is not, because it is for God we work--. It seems to me, I realize more & more every day the great & inestimable blessings of Faith & religious vocation, especially when I have heard in the parlor the trials of person in all conditions, highest as well as lowest, who seem to seek comfort in the peaceful influence of the Convent--. As Mrs. Lowe has not arrived, I suppose we may expect you on the 26th. Stella will I hope be ready, & Mrs Lamb seems earnestly preparing--. She brought her little Boy-- a fine little fellow, with her on last Sunday, to see us-- ought she not to have it Baptised at the same time with herself--? You will be sorry to hear that we have a case of Scalatina in our house-- little Mary Enright of Abbeville first had Measles, & now has scarlatina-- she is very sick & John has written to her Father-- (Saturday morning) Mary will go to Confession tomorrow after Mass & make her first Communion--. for we would not forgive ourselves if she died without the Sacraments. But she may get well--.[End Page 2] Sister De Neri says she is a \"child of obedience\" (which she really is) \"for she is going to be much [better?] as you told her to do--\" The rest are as you left, & happy to see such beautiful spring weather Our Children seem to partake of the disturbing influence outside-- they are more unruly than we have ever before Known them to be-- but it is better to have them high-spirited, than sick--. I have this morning received a letter from a Mrs George G [McWhater?] of Augusta Georgia who wishes to send a Miss Eliza Hugerford to us-- It seems the young lady is a case-- Did you write to Miss Jones--? I hope she will not come until I can get up some bedsteads & make a few house arrangements-- I have a second-hand Harp offered me with stand for $300.-- shall I buy it--? What about your papers in the event of an attack on Charleston which I see the Yankees intend to make within 30 days--,? Shall we subscribe to the Gunboat--? The Va. did such good work-- didn't it--? All join me in grateful respects & beg your blessing & prayers-- especially Ellen & myself-- Sr Theresa prayed-- \"a whole heap\" for you on your Anniversaries she says--[End Page 3] John is dejected about his sick children who have scarlatina, & two of whom, give him very little rest at night-- Ellen-- [Anna?] Son & James are all sick sometimes better & sometimes worse--. All were well at home when Anna wrote day before yesterday-- Mother sent a nice dressing gown both to Srs Ursula Sr [illegible]. It was a real act of virtue for her to give the latter-- a strong act of obedience & self denial-- We expect the Huchets to reenter on Monday, they have been very polite sending us bouquets of flowers & other little presents thus removing any unpleasant feeling that may have arisen about their [remarks?] concerning their sickness. We will expect you on the 26th D.V. Pray for your truly affectionate Sister Ellen Sr Baptiste.[End Page 4]"
