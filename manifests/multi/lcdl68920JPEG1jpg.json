      "value": "May 25, 1938.\nDear Olive:\nI certainly was sorry that our trip to New Or-\nleans blew up. It all seemed so very difficult and rush-\ned getting to New Orleans from Miami. We would have had \nto take an aeroplane to Atlanta and another on from there\nto New Orleans, and it meant eight hours flying. To top\nthis off, Sidney was seasick all the war down in the plane\nto Miami and all the way back to Charleston. Sidney is a\npoor flyer, and the idea of facing five or six hours more\ndefeated him completely. As a matter of fact, I also knew\nthat he had abandoned all ideas of going to Mayo's. He\nwas dead set against it, and nothing on God's green earth\nwould have made him join Armant, so more or less the point\nof going to New Orleans and making such a big effort to\nget there was lost. Of course, I would have adored having \nseen you and also Hennen, but we will just have to do it\nanother time. Our time is getting fairly short as we are\nsailing on the Bremen on the 15th and we seem a little pressed\nat this point.\nAs to the fishing trip, it was a vow! Never in\nmy life have I seen anything like the number of fish we saw\ndown there. Our houseboat was perfect, all screened, and\nthe swellest crew you have ever known. We caught seventy-\neight fish, eighteen of which were tarpon, and all of them\nbig ones. It was really a field day. The weather was so \nmuch cooler than at Medway, as the thermometer never rose\nabove 80, and we had a wonderful breeze all the time. Flori-\nda is a swell summer resort as well as a winter one, I think.\nWe had a lot of laughs on the trip, and banker Eastman caught\nall the Jewfish. Sidney caught one enormous tarpon--it must\nhave weighed 175 lbs., but was only able to get the head into\nthe boat as a tiger shark came along a carried away most\nof the fish. We, however, paid no attention to barracudas\nand the sharks and swam off the boat three times a day.\nPlease forgive us for not turning up, and for not\ngoing through with our original plans. I was certainly de-\nlighted to hear that Armant is going out to Mayo's anyhow.\nI am sure it will do him a world of good. As a matter of\nfact, Sidney slept so much on the Edna B, our houseboat,\nhad little or no exercise, ate so much fish chowder that he\nlooks like a million dollers, and has never felt better in\nhis life. Morris arrives today from New Orleans, and I think\nwe will all be in New York by May 30 to see the big $100,000\nstake at Belmont.\n[End Page 1]\n-3-\nWith lots of love, \nDevotedly,\nMrs. Armant Legendre,\n6333 Prytania St.,\nNew Orleans, La.\n[End Page 2]"
