      "value": "Carolina ART  Association   GIBBES ART Gallery   Charleston 5, S.C .   January 28, 1946   MEMO  TO: CIVIC SERVICES COMMITTEE, Carolina ART  Association   FROM: ROBERT N. S. Whitelaw, DIRECTOR     Mr. place has agreed to a meeting of the Civic Services Committee   February 6th, 5 P.M.; at the Gibbes Art Gallery.     I have been evauating the work of the Committee and have come to certain concusions . A of us have been somewhat disappointed that our off-street parking plan has not had a more immediate reception. The Mayor has appointed a committee from City Council and we should hear from them prior to our February meeting. I do not fee that there is anything further that we can do on this particuar plan. I propose for your consideration that the Committee continue to function toward the following ends:   1.   et us cortinue wherever possible to coect and disseminate information on planning in general and specificay towards preservation of the architectural and hietoric values of the city.     2.   Charlestons businessmen have oontributed in the past 12 monthe epproximntey $15,000 in memberships and subscriptions to \"This Is Charleston\".       We new have over 200 members, eaeh contributing $25 or a tota of something over $5,000. We need a minimum of $10,000 to develop our second function of maintnining a permnnent planning organization staffed to render assistance to city and county officias ana to other organizations.   3. Charleston has no overa plan emd none is contempated. I believe that if we are to educate the city as to the need for such a plan, which would have to be maintained continuousy, we should at least proceed to provide a sketch-plan for the area.     4.   Charlestons mutitudes of institutions, organizations and committees could be of greater service to the Community. but at present they create a considerable disorganization as they are uncoordinated and frequently uninformed of the existence or work of other organizations which may be dupicating their efforts. Together with the welfare Counci, we could anayze this situation by keeping a ive index of a organizations, their personne, work, and objectives.   5.   Kenneth Chorey last year proposed that the Civic Services Committee take immediate steps toward the formation and incorporation of a Charleston Foundation, with representatives from other institutions, whose purpose would be to maintain a permanent planning dopartment and to accept gifts and property to maintain historic or architeturay valuable houses. I concur with Mr. Chorey and hope that the Committee will give this matter carefu consideration at an eary date.       RNSW: es"
