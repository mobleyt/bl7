      "value": "Housing Job We Done  The announcement by the Charleston  Housing Authority that sufficient living  units have been buit or are now under  construction to serve theLocalneeds of the  army and navy is wecome news, and in  view of this condition the authority has exercised good judgment in recommending  that no more Public housing be undertaken.  Under the guidance of Edward D. Cement,  the authority has administered a tremendous  program, invoving $21,819,317  for sixteen  projects, with sound judgment and considerable wisdom.  Though expenditure of government  funds for housing purposes has drawbacks  which The News and Courier has pointed  out in the past, there is no denying that  the war changed the ordinary conditions and  made a certain amount of emergency construction with Federal funds unavoidable. A  community of this size could not possiby  have suppied housing facilities by itself for  the infux of war workers.  The housing authority has carried out a  difficut; job in what appears to The News  and Courier to be a businessike manner,  and the freedom from serious criticism of  its accompishments speaks we for the men  who have had chlarge of it. The decision  to call a hat when the immediate needs are  suppied, instead of attempting to grab more  money merey for the sake of spending it,  is  Additional evidence of good sense."
