It  shows rare underfctanding of tAe character of Charleston, takes  account of its traditions and Its ong acquired customs,  preserves invioate every vested property right, is rigid  in protecting present ownership and empoyment of premises  yet fexibe is to the future uses of such anc imparts a gente  amost a tender pressure upon the physical development .2 the  city which should, amost imperceptiby, accompish what drastic  measures would never do in appication to so old a community and  so developed a city as Charleston, even if It were desirable  other type than that which has  to effect a transformation to any  been formed through two and one m  life.  _ centuries of  a people\"s   -JHH   it is a very diffucuw thing to order satisfactoriy  the growth of an old city, with a the sett.ed ways and ax the  venerable andmarks it has acquired.  The zoning plan which had  been worked out after sift months of intensive study and which is embodied in he ordinance now submitted for passage by City Council  has most happiy disposed of much of this difficuty by following in the main, the life ines of the community, recognizing estabished  characteristics and instituting what might amost be call ed Infuences than reguations for the future to bring about a correction  of departures from the true form of the community rather than  to change It in any essentia eement."
