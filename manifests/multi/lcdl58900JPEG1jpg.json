      "value": "HISTORY AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CIVIC SERVICES COMMITTEE  CAMPAIGN FOR FUNDS September 25 - 29 1945  The first concerted endeavor toward scientific planning  in Charleston in modern times was made \"by the city government in  1931 during the administration of Mayor Thomas P. Stoney. intimately concerned in this endeavor were James O\"Hear, Co. Aston  Deas and Major Albert Simons. Morris-Knowes, a planning and  engineering firm of Phiadephia, made the studies and executed  the master plan for the city. The Zoning ordinances - associated  in the Public mind only with preservation of two small areas of  \"od and historic Charleston,\" but actuay embracing zoning matters throughout the entire city - were adopted by City Council at  that time. The City planning and Zoning Commission, the Board of  architectural Review and the Board of Adjustment were created to  administer the ordinances. unfortunately, for the ordinances attracted wide attention and approva, the only paid city official  concerned with it was the City Engineer whose office was already  overburdened. No city appropriation has been avaiable for planning since 1931.  The next move toward planning was made by a small group  of individuals eary in 1940. The group included E. Miby Burton,  John Mead Howes, James O\"Hear, Homer M. place, Sidney J. Rttenberg,  Albert Simons, Miss Alice R. Huger Smith, Samuel G, Stoney and  Robert N. S. Whitelaw. This group ater became the Civic Services  Committee. It had become apparent to many that the \"distinctive  and charming amenity\" of Charleston was threatened by loss and  change brought about through ignorance, indifference, economic  necessity, and the mere pressure of living. The committee therefore studied the effects of i-considered restorations and haphazard explansion, upon things that are historically, architecturally  or estheticay important and with these problems of traffic, housing, recreation, etc., as they affected the physical appearance and  cultural values of the city.  The Civic Services Committee was sponsored by the Carolina Art  Association in order that it receive financia support  from individuals and foundations. The  Association has received  grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation  for expenditure during the past 4 years totaing 127,000.00. We  have spent to date $38,00000 and at the present time there are no  funds avaiable for the continuance of the Committee\"s work.  Next in the planning sequence, the national Resources  planning Board, represented in this area by George W. Simons, Jr.,  interested Senator Cotsworth P. Means and the County Deegation in  securing egisative action to estabish a county planning board.  This board was created in Juy, 1942 and was given a county appropriation. It terminated its activities when the appropriation  was not made in June, 1945.  The Civic Services Committee, begun in 1940, has continued with a greaty enlarged membership. Its first members were \n\n[End Page 1]\na either architectural historians or individuals professionay  concerned with the cultural life of the city. Their objective  was and still is to devise ways and means of preserving as much  as possible of Charlestons unique architecture, not in any sense  as static museum pieces, but as usefu parts of a living community  potentialy of enormous value to the city as a whole. The committee eary realized that city planning was the only method of  accompishing this, and that a aspects of the life of the community must be considered. The enlarged membership of the committee  has therefore been drawn from a interests, social and economic as  we as cultural.  For the past several years the Committee has maintained a  staff and has retained the services of Mr. George W. Simons, Jr.  and Mr. Henry P. Staats, A.I.A as consutants and has prepared a  solution to the traffic and parking problem of the central business  district of Charleston for presentation to City Council at the request of Counci.  It is now asking that 400 Patron Memberships in the Civic  Services Committee at $25.00 each be secured, payable to the Carolina Art Associaltion. A memberships are tax exempt and a will  be isted in the Associaltion\"s magazine and can be considered as  advertising. Patron Memberships do not include privieges of the  Dock Street Theatre. The fund secured will be used in its entirety  for:  1] competion of the off-street parking plan,  2] developing programs for the physical improvement of  the Charleston Area,  3] retention and restoration of real estate values,  4] coaboration with other organizations for the preservation of our. architecture as an historical heritage and as an  asset for the tourist trade,  5] explansion of the Civic Services Committee\"s program  of \"planning with the people\"   a unique method of gliving every  citizen an opportunity to hep shape the esthetic growth of Charleston. \n\n[End Page 2]"
