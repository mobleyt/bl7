April 21st 1860 I have written so much to you of late that this time I will only say a few words -- Sr Johanna recd a letter from Mr Ambler Weed, in which he says - \"the Bishop (McGill) enters fully into your wishes to perform the ceremony for you, but says he does not know what to preach about - he will go to Charleston after the convention as Bishop Lynch requested he would wait until after it had adjourned _.\" It behooves us to appoint the day for the reception & make our preparations accordingly. I would prefer the 3rd of May - if convenient, if not then the 8th of May. Please let me know as soon as you can what day would suit you best, if either or [Written on side]: I suppose you will do the civil & write inviting him &c though I have no guest? for him[End Page 1] some others, & we will make our own arrangements accordingly. I am sorry to have this interruption to our school duties which are doubly pressing now & shall be until the Distribution -- but I trust it will be -- A.M.D.G. I received a short letter from Lucas with two copies of their edition of Ursuline Manual which I had sent for. The principal one of the firm is sick but will write more satisfactory soon. What do you think of the Building Committee affairs? When I wrote there remained one hundred shares. which John is anxious we should take - now there is seventy five, twenty five of which John took in his own name for us - there remain fifty shares yet, which he hopes we will with your permission take - please write soon. How comes on the Fair? My love to Anna - kind regards to Mrs Monroe (?) &c. John is going down in a day or two. I am thinking of very quietly sending by him $300.00 to the Srs Mercy & getting a receipt (?), without making any allusion to their letter - Shall I? I don't feel easy about them. Please pray for us & give us your benediction - Your own sister Ellen Sr Baptiste[End Page 2]"
