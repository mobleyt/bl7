      "value": "To Mrs Sidney J. Legendre,\nO.S.S. Detachment,\nA.P.O. No. 887\nPostmaster, NEW YORK\nFrom\nLt. S. Legendre USNR\nPS BOX 166, Commandant\nNavy No. 128\nFL PO San Francisco\nDecember 19, 1943\n73\nDear Gertie,\nChrismas is rushing at us and I long so to be with you and spend\nat least the day with you. To have a little tree and our present together\nand maybe a fat spaniel to hug and play with. It would be heaven but then\none must not think of these things when they are unobtainable. I received\nyour letters 29,30, 32 today and loved them. You write such wonderful\nletters , so full of news, and so interesting that I absolutely live for\nthem. I am so gald you are able to go out and play golf on the weekends\nocassionaly and that you have an opportunity to see doodles and breath a\nlittle fresh air. It makes such a difference in your feelings and view\npoint on life. God only knows where stories about Morris and I start. We\ndo nothing, see no one, and as I told you in a letter before I did not even\nknow that I had seen Percy, Fraser, but thought that he might have been\nthe one that had talked to [me] about Ellen so much. Where he obtained the news\nthat Morris and I had bought a house is quite beyond me. We have not bought\nso much as an out house, and are living in the same apartment, and will\nprobably continue to do so until the end of the war in 1949. We have not\nbeen to see as house for the last three or four months and have no interest\nin one. Next question in your letter is \"what is my cable Address\". I\nwill give it to you with the advise to please send me a letter telling what\nwas in the cable for I will never receive the latter. The address is Lt\nS.J. Legendre, US Navy, Pearly Harbor. I did not know you had to send my \nnumber. You can well imagine my shames of receiving a cable with that\naddress. As I told you in a previous letter men out here only hear of the\ndeath of their families when they receive the condolence letters as the\ncables advising them of the fact never appear until months latter. I am\nalso amused at your saying why don't I write to your APO No. It seems to\nme that I have been doing so for months. But then I must realize that it\ntakes a mo[n]th for my letter to reach you then another month for your reply\nto reach me and a third mo[n]th for me to answer and tell you what I have to \ndo about it. I guess when the war is over we will have to stay in our \nrespective places for at least three mo[n]ths for our mail to cathc up with us\nNew interesting to have met those people from Charleston. Did they think as\nwe did that it was a dead place in a dreary climate with dull people and\nwretched food. I am certain they must have been very glad to arrive in a\nland where the war is the present one and not one that took place fifty \nyears or so ago. I received a killing letter from Rose about her visit\ndown [t]here and in it you will note she said that which I xxx use to reiterate[,]\nthat the place was running better with just Walter and David and Rosa than\nwith all the servants, she had never seen it look lovilier. Four fifths\nof the trouble with Medway was that we made it so dam difficult for ourselves\nby always doing something that we never had time to enjoy it. Lats hope\nsomeone else will get some pleasure out of it. Henry said he hear unofficialy\nthat we were to receive [illegible] for he damage done to our lake by\nthe canal. This sounds [illegible]\nSidney Legendre"
