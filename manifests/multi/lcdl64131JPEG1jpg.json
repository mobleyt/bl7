      "value": "[John Laurens to Francis Kinloch\nAugust 23, 1774\n[RvW Box 1, Folder 1 MSS. – A.L.S.]]\n\nDear Kinloch\nAfter a pleasant Ride through a very fine\nPart of France, I arrived in London on the 7th of this month,\nbut figure to yourself my Grief and Mortification, at finding that\nmy Father had set out that day fortnight in order to meet me.\nI knew how great his Anxiety and Uneasiness would be on\nmy Account, and therefore left Town the next day, and tra-\n-velling without intermission, reached the Fauxbourg St. Germain\non the 11th at day break, where I had the happiness of relieving \nmy Good Father from much Concern - we staid a day or two\nat Paris where we had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Blake, who\nenquired very kindly after you. R. Izard jun.r, Grimke [and] ca. and\nI am but just returned from my new Journey - let this apolo-\n-gize for my not writing to you sooner. I waited on your\nFriend Mr. Boone, And as he was out of town, I left your\nLetter with a Card – had I not been afraid of detaining any\nlonger, what can never fly too quick or come too often to him \ngood news from you, I should have had the pleasure of deli-\n-vering the Letter to him myself.\nIf my Letter is a little confused, dont be surpriz'd\nat it, for I am quite like a Creature in new World, and \nshall be for some time in an unsettled State.  I am\nglad however to inform you that I shall not have Lod-\n-gings in the Temple as I at first thought, but in some\ngenteel private Family.  the Noise, the Cries the Smoak [sic]\nand Dust of this vast City, make me sometimes wish\nmyself back at Paquis, I have another Reason too, for wish\n-ing myself there, I dont know when I shall get into\nsuch a valuable Set of Acquaintance as I have left –\n[End Page 1]\nbut perhaps for the present, the fewer Acquaintance I have,\nthe better it will be for me.  I am confirm'd in the opinion\nthat you and I both had at Geneve [sic] respecting our young\nCountrymen, by what I have seen and heard since my\nArrival here – I can write you nothing satisfactory as yet\nof American Affairs, the English Soldiers it is said begin\nto desert, the colonist are forming into Committees to consult\nwhat is to be done in their present Circumstances, the\nCarolinians are to send Rice and other necessaries for the\nRelief of their distress'd Brethren at Boston. A General\nCongress will be held at Philadelphia or New York, the Deputies\nto be sent there by the Province of SoCarolina, are Henry Middle-\n-ton, T. Lynch, C. Gadsden, J. Rutledge, and Edward Rutledge the\nYoung Man who lately went over, and who has already acquir'd\na great degree of Celebrity. Tell Lord Lumley that I hope\nhe continues a good Friend to the Americans, be so kind as to \npresent my best Compliments to him Mr. Clayson, Moore the Duke\nand Harvey. I wish them all a great deal of Happiness and\nPleasure at Geneve – it grows so late that I must bid you\nAdieu, kiss all the pretty Genevoises for me and dont\ndelay to write to your affectionate \nJohn Laurens.\n\nFludyer Street Westminster –\n23d August 1774\nDirect to me at the Carolina Coffee House.\n[End Page 2]"
