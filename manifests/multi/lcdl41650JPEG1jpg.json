      "value": "F. Lynch Cheraw 27 July 1859 Rt. Revd. And Dear Brother As time and tide wait for no one, so my notes at Bank have fixed periods, when attention is directed to them. With this is illegible for 4000$ which please endorse and trade at the Bk of the S of SC. I have $62 there on deposit which will cover the illegible. As I much feared you have overworked yourself during the hot days of summer. I am glad you are now resting (if you know how to do such thing) from your labors, and hope soon you will feel quite recovered Brother Hugh and family and Sister Anna reached home last night all well. For my own part I am [End Page 1] in excellent health. Henrietta and the children too are quite well so are Father and Mother and Revd Mr. Cullinan. All join in love and begging your prayers. I am delighted at the termination of the war with the relations with the Holy See. The policy that would desire the illegible of all temporal power has been thwarted (that's a hard word to write) and brings to my mind the deacon's address to Gov. Seymour. Today we have indication of a N. Easter the weather is cloudy and cool and although tis past the 25th July no excitement is astir with the illegible people here Ever asking your prayers, I am your afft Bro F. Lynch [End Page 2]"
