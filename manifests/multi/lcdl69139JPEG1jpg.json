      "value": "Letter 12\nDecember 25, 1944\nMrs Gertrude S. Legendre,\n1st. Lt. WAC\nU.S. Prisoner of War in Germany,\n[at] International Committee of the Red Cross Directory Service,\nGeneva\nSwitzerrland,\nVia New York, N.Y\nGertie Darling,\nToday is Christmas. How strange it seems as I sit here\nto think that you are in a prison camp. E ven a fortune teller could\nnot foreee these things that come up in ones life. Maybe the one that\nlived in Summerville and did not give you a peek at the f[u]tu[r]e saw what was\ncoming and just took your money but did not think he should let you\nknow what was going to happen. About the only consolation that I can give\nyou is that you can be fairly certain that this will probably be the worst\nChristmas that you will ever spend. To this I think you will add a strong\n\"AMEN\".\nLast night was wonderful. I had two twenty five pound turkies\nto dress and cook. I could not leave them for today because like any other\nday we are at the office and will only get home a few minutes before our\nguests arrive for dinner. First I cleaned then and found all sorts of things\nthat I did not know turkeis possessed , Then came the making of the stuffing\nLoaves of bread were torn apart and divided into little pieces. To this greet\nmass of dough I added six cans of oysters, chopped celery, cayenne pepper,\ncelery salt,milk, some kind of meat sauce and everything else that was in\nthe kitchen. The entire mixture tas then kneeded and pounded until it\nlooked really terrible. When this point had been arrived at I fi lled each t\nturkey full and sewed than up. Into the ovens they went. One oven I set at\nthree fifty and the other at two fifty. It was eleven oclock by now so\nI fell into bed smelling of turkey and stuffing to the point where I\nvowed that I would never est a piece of turkey again in my life. While\nthis ha[d] been going on Morris had been hanging wre[a]ths and bits of tinsel\non everything. However he has become so met[h]odical th[a]t he does not hang\nanyting without measuring to see if it is the same height from the floor as\nsomething else. The result is that though he has been pottering around the\napartment for the past three nights I can not see that there has been\nany great change. This morning I bounced out of bed bright and early\nand swung open the oven door that had been set at three fifty degrees.\nYou have never seen such a sight in your life. The turkey had swollen up\nto the size of a hippo and all the stuffing had burst out. His legs which I\nhad tied together had broken in two and the skin was raised up in great\nair bubbles like that fish in paper begs that Morris always talks about in\nNew Orleans. It can safely be said that it was the most terrifying sight\nthat I h[a]ve ever seen. The entire oven seemed to be full of turkey. Most of\nit had exploded over everything but theire were sections that had remained\nintact and this I tied together again. The other turkey that had been xet\n[End Page 1]\nat a lower temperature was a wonderful golden brown and looked delicious.\nGuess we just overcooked the explosive one.\nSomehow before the guests arrive I have to make a corn pudding\nand heat up the green peas. If things follow their usual course I expect th\npuddings to swell up to such a size that there will not be room for the\nguests in the apartment and it will even run down the steps to meet them\nin true christmas style. Personnally I believe everyone would have been\nfar happier with a lot to drink and a sandwhich rather than this grand\nstyle dinner but the old man says no, this is what they want.\nElmer Lee and his orchestra are going to be there playing soft\nmusic and I expect before the evening is over everyone will be up and\non their feet trying to prove they know how to do those south sea island\ndances. There will be s great deal of wiggling and not very much\ndancing. As yet I have not attmepted to learn then but after demands\nfor exhibitions while I was back in the states I think that if my old\nbones will hold out I will have to learn a turn and a twist here and\nthere. \nJust so I would not starve over the season I went to the\nclub last night and had the most delicius turkey dinner. All white meat\nwith lots of stuffing and good things. The orchestra was playing\nholy night and all the old christns carrols. It was so lovely listening\nto the soft music and looking out over the calm sea at the sinking sun.\nI felt that I could look across that shinning blue surface and see you\naway off in the distance just on the horizon. I felt that you were comming\ntowards me and somehow for a while you did not seen so far off but were\nclose and I could see your smile, your brown eyes and the little curls\non your forehead. All the memories of the Christmases we had spent together,\nof the laughter and happiness as we opened our presents, the squeeks from\nthe little rubber mice the dogs had received, Bos delighted crys over\nnot the presents but the ribbon they were wrapped in, the making of the\neggnogg, and then all the negroescomming for their presents. The little\nones so shinning and clean in their white dresses , the big onles shuffing\ntheir feet and saying happy christmas Missis, happy Christmas Boss. Then\nthe enormous dinner , the protrnding stomachs, and the sleep on he sofas\nafterwards. What fun and happiness that was and how long it has been\nsince we have known it. However everything must have an ending sometimes,\nand I suppose that this war will come to an end somedays. If not by next\nchristms at least in three or four years  Then we can once more start\ndoing all the things we like and making plans that would take six\ngenerations of long living people to carry out.\nGoodbye darling. I am so sorry that you are going through\nthis dreadful period and I feel so dreadful that there is nothing\nthat I can do. You use to say that you could not understand why I could\nnot do something about your coming out here and now you probably wonder\nwhy I cannot do something about getting you out. Please believe me that\nthe answer is the same in both cases. This letter brings you all my love\nand I can only hope that before very long they will exchange you and that\nyou will be home again.\nSidney Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
