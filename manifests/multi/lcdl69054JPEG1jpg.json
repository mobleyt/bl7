      "value": "April 12, 1943\nDear Gertie ,\nTwo no. 15s, one of April 3, and one of April 5 and then another\nin a latter mail of today , which was still ahother 15 arrived today.\nThe letter telling me about the rumoir that I was at the Dillinghams\ndrunk and disorderly and was reprimanded by an Admiral made me so mad at\nfirst that I dam near died. However I soon cooled down and had a good\nlaugh. First I do not know the Dillinghams, second I have never been hee for d-\ndinner, thirdly I do not know an Admiral so have not bee[N] reprimanded.\nYou can rest assured that the person who told you the story is a bed liner\nbecause an Admiral would~not think of bothering to reprimand you about\nauythirg. It is the duty of the commanding officer to do this. The\nAdmiral would write him a letter asking that action be taken and the officer\nwould rite the admiral that action had been taken and discribing it.\nI know all about these things because I exp administrativeo officer.\nIt is really amazing how stories start wi out any foundation at all.\nI em so glad you wrote this to me so that I could at least tell :ttxho you\nthat it had never happened. Of course hundreds of people will hear the story\n- embellish on it and retell this espisode until they will lmve he raping\nthe old lady on a card table while lorris stood by with a bottle in his hand\nstaggering drunkenly as he burped softly. However let me know the name ad\naddress of the person who told it to you so hat I can tell the SOB what I\nthink and that I intend to knock his face off when I return.\nAs I have told you in so mam' letters I have been to the\nfollowing three dinner . 1] The old Colonel ard his wife that knew Olive\nLegendre. 2] Her daughter's house, Mrs Moody, 3] Mrs Wilders. Mrs Wilders\nwas the place I went last Saturday night and left so early. I never drakk\nat any of these dinners nor was I rude. In fact I poured the butter on\nso thick that you could not cut it with a knife. I don't drink because\nI am afraid that I night say someth-ing that was secret, and I don't go out\nunless I am caught in e trap. At the last dinner an old hag asked me\nif I would come to dinn_er on Monday. I said no and said no to the next four\ndays. I agreed to come on Friday and will call her up Thursday and\nsay I am on night duty. They are a pain in the neck. I bet some old \nwitch who had it in for Mrs Dillingham made up the story to get a kick in at\nher with never a thought of how it would affect me. Anyway to hell with it.\nI am as busy as a bird dog seeing that things are packed into -cases\nand that everything is marked with the heme of the room and the officer or man\nusing it. At the end I am certain that no one will find anything but it will\nnot affect their work because they probably would not recognize it anyway. \nWill write you again after we move and tell you all the funny things that\nhappened. \nlove to you darling\nSidney"
