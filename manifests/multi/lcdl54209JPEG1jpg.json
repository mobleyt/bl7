      "value": "My Dear Norman My last, (which by the way will be first with you) closed with the departure of the Train from Fair Bluff to Wilmington, freighted with somewhat, doubtful material, in many ways. First, material that Father Mathew or Judge 0'Neall would have repudiated as not entirely conforming to their peculiar notions on the subject of Temperance. Second material that would be doubted in any Court of Justice where Moral Honesty was regarded as an essential requisite and indeed every where but on the Plen-ta-bhun [plantation]. My own departure from that centre of civilization was not marked by anything Strange or interesting, it will suffice to say, that I left. I reached Columbia from which Point I droped [dropped] you a Note and now I am here, but as this place and its peculiarities, its visitors, and their different characters, looks, manners and appearances, as they strike my mind, require deliberation to give them to you in such a Photographic manner as I think they deserve, and as the iron tounge [tongue] of time has just proclaimed lowe [low] twelve I must pause and deliberate before I write them down for after they are once written they shall follow the fortunes of Shackspears [Shakespeare's] works \"not a line shall be blotted out”\n[End Page 1]\nThe Arrival Vide Congdon time 4 o'clock P.m. tired, weary Hungry, Thirsty mad generally, a strange mysterious unaccountable don't care a D—n sort of feeling has imperceptibly grown upon me enhanced no doubt, by the pleasure of expecting every miniut [minute] to see one if not two of my, by no means troublesome off spring dashed headlong through a Car window by their Juvenile attempts to break limbs off the bushes that grow by the Roadside. A sudden Curve in the Road. Cars are slackened whistle bloun [blown]. people look out of the Windows, a stop is made, by the side of a sheltered Platform, where many persons are Congregated, the Conductor opens the Door and Says \"Wiliamston\" a rush is made, I am descending the steps of the Car with one Basket, one Carpet Bag, two shawls, a Parasol, one Child and two small Bundles. I alight in safety in the arms of Col Jordan deposite [deposit] my load, assist out the rest of my live encumbrances, see my Trunks unmercifully dumped down, give my checks to a small man with black whiskers, and breath a prayer to Heaven that I am once more on the dirt and that there is no immediate and pressing necessity for the Dirts being on me.\n[End Page 2]\nA Day at Williamston Sunrise. Get up wash, Drink some water. Put on Pants, drink some more water, finish dressing and take a glass of water, take a walk to the Spring for an early Drink of Water. Bring back a cup full for my family offer it to them beginning with the maternal Head, no foot of the family, she takes 31 drops insists that it is splendid but declines any more, offer it successively to the minor branches, all refuse. I resolve that it shall not be wasted and Drink it myself. Breakfast Waiter give me some Tea. Waiter we are just out of tea Sah but have some fresh Water, how was these Eggs cooked Boiled, Sah Well D—n you I knew that but what were they Boiled in. Spring water Sah. the soup is put by for Dinner Sah. Well in Gods name give me some bread and Butter. I finish on Bread, Butter, Spring water, Doughnuts and Dams, retire feel sullen and watery. 11 O'clock A.M. feel weak about the Stomach, can't imagine what the matter is, try some water, don't feel any better, think again have vivid reccelections [recollections] of a Small Papered Room with a Table in it and\n[End Page 3]\nand a string running through the wall and connecting itself with a bell, a flash of intelligence seems to connect me with that same string. I make a rush for the Door, meet a waiter. Boy. I say Boy have you any other kind of Bars about this House besides Bars of Soap? Oh Yes Sah Bar under the House off side. Make a Dash for it find it. Door Locked, find the man what kin unlock it; go in look around smell something odd a cross between a wet Dog and Tan Ooze, give me a drink of Pale Brandy. Haven't got it. Well give me Whiskey, haven't got it. Jin? [Gin] no. Rum? no. Bay Rum? no. Assafoetida? no. Camp fire? no. Paregoric? no. Brouns Essence of Jamaca [Jamaica] Ginger? no. Cholera Medicine? no. Fly Poison? no. Well my friend in the name of Christ and the Eleven Apostles what have you got.? Spring Water Sir. Oh Beaty, Beaty, don't you feel auful [awful] oh my Poor stomach. Oh my uneducated Bowels. Oh my expectant but disappointed Kidneys. I feel too weak to go on. Norman go rite strait off and mix too good Juleps this minuit [minute] tell Gurgandes [Gurganus] to charge them to me. Drink one yourself and tell John Darby no he Drinks Whiskey strait tell Bill Wilson to Drink the other while I drink Water.\n[End Page 4]"
