Whitelaw, Director  Carolina Art  Association  Gobes Art Gallery  Charleston, S. C.  Dear Bob:  I have been studying the cards turned  in by Miss McCormack and an very much peased  with her work, especiay her photographs which,  after a, are our most important records.  Besides individual houses I would ike to see  her take more groups where several houses of  interest happen to be neighbors.  The value of  the individual house is greaty augmented if it  is a conforming eement in an harmonious group.  In order to conserve Miss McCormack\"s  time and perhaps arrive at more accurate cassifications than an individual working aone can  give, I would suggest that she leave bank the  following categories:  Source of interest;  Period; quality Rating.  These should, I think, be checked by  the subcommittee of Sam Stoney, John Howes and  mysef.  Sam and I can each give our separate  notations and when these are at variance John  can cast the deciding vote when we send the cards  to him for review.  If Miss MoCormack can estabish the date  of a buiding she should by a means note it on  the card but in most instances the period of a  buiding has to be determined by the character of  the architecture and it is expecting too much of  a ayman, no matter how observant, to read the  character indications accuratey. \n\n[End Page 1]\nMr. Whitelaw  -2-  13 May 1941  I am not making this suggestion in  any spirit of criticism of the work Miss McCormack  is doing but I fee that we have demanded more  of her than is entirey fair.  I am a for the  work she is doing and only want to reieve  her of that part of it which must be a source  of embarrassment to her.  Sincerely yours,  Albert Simons  AS:ER \n\n[End Page 2]"
