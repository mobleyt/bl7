      "value": "Judah P. Benjamin (1811-1884), US senator, Confederate statesman, and sugar planter, was born in the British-occupied Danish West Indies (modern-day Virgin Islands). The Benjamin family immigrated to the United States shortly after Benjamin’s birth and resided in North and South Carolina. Benjamin’s father was a founding member of Charleston, South Carolina’s Reformed Society of Israelites, the first effort to reform Judaism in the United States. Judah Benjamin moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1832, where he entered private practice as a commercial lawyer and established a sugar plantation. After serving in the Louisiana state legislature for ten years, Benjamin was elected to the US senate, becoming the second Jewish senator in US history. After Louisiana seceded from the Union in 1861, Benjamin was elected Attorney General of the Confederacy. Soon afterwards he assumed the positions of Secretary of War (September 1861-March 1862) and Secretary of State (March 1862-May 1865). Benjamin relocated to England after the war, and later moved to France, where he died in 1884."
