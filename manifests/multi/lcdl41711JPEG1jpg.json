      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent Columbia S.C. Sept 21st/60 My dearest Brother, I have so much to say, & so little time to say it in, that I do not know where to begin. First, I forgot the letters to the Abp, & booksellers as you know -- all I could do, was to post them immediately - & I would have written you at the same time if I could. Well Messrs Kelly, Hedian & Piet wrote to me yesterday meeting our proposal half well, at the same time, saying if we did not accept their proposal after reasons which they (illegible), they would accept [End Page 1] ours. We have thought it best to accept theirs -- & accordingly wrote to them today saying so, & as they mentioned their interview with you &c -- we said where we had learned from you what alterations it would be requisite for us to make, & we would send our revisions & draw up with them the agreement they had expressed a readiness to enter upon. We also wrote by the aid of John an order on \"Lucas Brothers\" for the plates which we sent to Kelly, Hedian & Piet -- and in answering \"Lucas & Bros.\" sent a draft on K. H & P payable 18 mos. after (illegible) for plates of Ursuline Manual -- which closes for us the business of the plates. Miss Addie Lowe arrived [End Page 2] the day after you left. I think. She is a remarkably fine looking & prepossessing person. I trust she may wear well, & always have as good dispositions as she now evinces. She unfortunately lost her portfolio of drawing's in Columbia, which she has not recovered. This morning I received an offer of a Lay Sister postulant, from Rev P. ONeill, of Charleston. I wrote him word we would not refuse any one recommended by him, yet at present did not need any -- enquired her age, strength &c could she wash & iron, &c &c. Eliza has been indisposed- [End Page 3] but is better. All the rest very well. We have a new boarder Miss Maussenet a little girl from Macon, Georgia, & expect another. All satisfactory & good children I am told. Conlaw & John went over home last Saturday -- all well there Anna says & in Texas. Old Mr. Spann very ill (illegible) All send grateful respects & beg your prayers & benediction especially your devoted sister Ellen Sr Baptiste Please write soon [End Page 4]"
