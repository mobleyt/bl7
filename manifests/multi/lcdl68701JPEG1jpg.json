      "value": "IN REPLY ADDRESS NOT THE SIGNER\nOF THE LETTER, BUT\nCOMMANDING OFFICER.\nSMALL CRAFT TRAINING CENTER,\nROOSEVELT BASE, TERMINAL ISLAND.\nSAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA\nU. S. NAVAL\nSMALL CRAFT TRAINING CENTER\nROOSEVELT BASE, TERMINAL ISLAND\nSAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA\nSunday , Nov 14 , 1943.\nDear Sid-- I was just about to answer your letter saying that it \"is all off\"\nwhen I now receive your later one saying \"its in the bag\". This is your \"V\"\nletter dated Nav 7. You say your \"Colonel\" is now asking for me--have you \nswitched to the Army ? Well mebbe this time it will go through. Isnt there\nsomething I can do from this end ?\nWhen all this started last February , I suggested to you that it might be\nwell for me to go to Washington and follow it up from that end, but you advised\nagainst this. The reason I ask again is because Raoul Vallon [who is now here\nwith me ] had tried for several months to get out here and it was only when he\nstarted working from both ends that results were forthcoming. That is, he had\nCapt Huntoon ask for him at this end, and then he had his commanding officer in\nNew Orleans agree to his release from that job and had him write a letter to\nBupers agreeing to the release.\nI think that I wrote you in my last letter that I had once more requested \nsea duty. Incidentally my knee is coming on fine and I took a special physical I\nexam which I passed okay. Well anyway , the Capt agreed to release me for sea\nduty around the end of this year as he figured by that time Raolu Vallon would \nbe able to take over my job here. When your letter cam in yesterday I thought\nI better go ses him to ascertain if he had yet received a request from Bupers\nfor me to go to Pearl Harbor. He said he had heard absolutely nothing. So I\ntold him I would like to join you two if such a request same in and asked him\nif he would release me now instead of waiting untill the end of the year. I told\nhim I thought that Vallon could take over right new with the organisation that\nI have built up. He said \" I will see\". Be wouldnt say definitely 'yes' or \"no\"\n, but I think he would let me go if it comes to a show down as all the dirty\nwork has now been completed in my dept and the rest is just routine. I didnt\nask him to write a letter to Bupers saying that he would release me to go to\njoin you , as first I wanted to write you and find out if you think this would\nbe wise. What do you think ? If you think he should write such a let ter to\nBupers, what is the exact title of the outfit that I would be attached to and\nshould I mention my assignement there for any special duty. Also should I mention\nthat I'm being requested for this duty by \"Colonel\" so-and-so ? Untill I hear\nfrom you I shall do nothing but keep my fingers crossed.\nDid you keep those pictures of the children I sent you , or have you torn\nthem up ? If you still have them please return the ones that include Bobby\nPhillips as my daughters want them for their album. Bobby is their \"hero\" and they\nswoon at the very thought of him ! They are doing fine at Foxcroft. As usual\nAnne is leading the entire school in marks. Kafrum is just \"getting by\". She tries\nhard but just doenst have Annes brain , but she surely is the sweetest child on\nearth. Olive had a letter from Miss Nolan saying \"Katharines has the most lovely\ndisposition that I have had to handle in years\". Guess she got it from me-- \n\"sweet tempered Arma\" they called me.\n[End Page 1]\nIN REPLY ADDRESS NOT THE SIGNER\nOF THE LETTER, BUT\nCOMMANDING OFFICER.\nSMALL CRAFT TRAINING CENTER,\nROOSEVELT BASE, TERMINAL ISLAND.\nSAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA\nU. S. NAVAL\nSMALL CRAFT TRAINING CENTER\nROOSEVELT BASE, TERMINAL ISLAND\nSAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA\nYou tell me to be sure and not come out in one of the new gray uniforns.\nPut your mind at ease, as I dont own one. I only got around to buying one of\nthe snappy tropical worsted Kahkis a month ago, so I have to wear that out first\nso I'm in hopes the war will be over before I have to buy any gray ones.\nI'm enclosing the last copy of our base Newssheet thinking you may be\ninterested in seeing my noble picture . Hang it over your bed to scare malaria\nmosqueitos away.\nI had a letter from Gertie yesterday and she is complaining that there\nisnt enough excitement in London, even in spite of the recent bombings! What\na gal ! Incidentally I read something in_this mornings paper where some big shot\npredicted that the Japs would bomb Pearl Harbor in the next two months--mebbe I\nbetter not be so anxious to come out after all !\nDid I tell you that I have taken up tennis again ? I have playing about\ntwo months now. I run at about half speed but it seems to be helping my knee\nand by the time I get out there I will be able to scamper around as of of old\n, taking balls that belong to m  partner and missing my own. If I could only\nget Eastman to switch from the Army to the Navy now and come out with me we\ncould have a little double at ten bucks a set--- you dogs still owe me about\n$50 as I recall it from that last game in New Orleans.'\nWell so long my fine fat friends. Let me new whether or not I should\nhave Capt Huntoon write Washington saying that he will release me if I’m requested\nby your command.\nArma\n[End Page 2]"
