      "value": "My Dear Day Charleston Augst 11th, 1834 I have begun your letter but can't promise myself to finish it today for that it is Monday and somewhat my day of leisure. Yet there are several parochial visits so be paid which will probably defer this letter until tomorrow, & then tomorrow there is a Lecture to be delivered by me in the Afternoon, which may postpone it until Wednesday, & then Wednesday there are subjects for sermons to be selected, & digested which would carry the unfortunate epistle to Thursday & so on to the end of this week and the beginning of the next. So the chances you see are sadly against the speedy completion of your letter. Since writing to you last I have got a letter from Hasell, and don't know that I can fill up the rest of this page with any thing better than an extract from his letter. I had informed him that Smith & yourself had both become Christians. He says in reply-- \"The information contained in your last in relation to Bull & Day has given me great pleasure--how delightful it is to hear of such happy changes in those so dear to us. I look forward to a seminar beyond the Tomb with those we delighted to mingle with on Earth. The indulgence of the Hope equals & refines our Friendship and adds tenfold to the joys they impart. The affectionate interest you manifest as to my own spiritual condition, Dear Barnwell, is feelingly appreciated & so I am dissatisfied with the small progress I have made in Christian excellence & that the gospel has not yet entirely become the guide of my [End Page 1] thoughts or the guide of my conduct, yet I desire to grow in grace & pray for the power to subdue my evil nature, that His grace & the love of Jesus may reign in my heart. Remember me my dear friend in your prayers and pray God Bless you and make you a favored instrument in the promotion [?] of his Glory. I have given the above at length as a better account of Hasells spiritual state than I could give in my own language--and I think you will agree with me that our friend is not far from the Kingdom of Heaven. Let us be more urgent in Prayer for him as well as our other companions. But while I feel grateful that God has so far heard our prayers as to help our friend--I am ashamed to acknowledge dear Day that I have often forgotten our appointed time of special Prayer--and such is the common faulty of our nature. I dare say it has been the same with you. Still let us thank God & take courage--and be more punctual in future. The Lord knows our weakness and if we will but resolve it His strength so improve His aid will not be wanting. I suppose you have suffered much from heat even in Catskill which I presume is a cold place. There it has been expensive yet I have suffered less than I had apprehended. My situation too is far from being airy and the Building in which my congregation at present worships is quite small & hot so that every thing has been against me, yet by the goodness of the Lord, my health has continued good. We are about building a new Church. It is something of an undertaking but we all trust in the Lord & hope for success. My flock is I hope in the sight paths following the good Shepherd who laid down his Life for the sheep. [End Page 2] Tho the congregation is small, my duties are somewhat arduous owing to the neglect of those excellent old rules which you cited in your last. However I am getting into better order and therefore am having more leisure. I received a week or two ago a pressing letter from a Brother Clergyman of the Episcopal Church -- the Revd Mr E. M. Johnson of Brooklyn urging me to pay him a visit of a few weeks. I could not help thinking( though at once it appeared as it is altogether impracticable) \"well what would Day think if one of these afternoons he should see me pop out of a Steam Boat at Catskill.\" But nothing except ill health could induce me to leave my congregation at present and this cause of course i hope sincerely will not exist, so that unless you determine dear Day to avail yourself of one of the Steam Packets & pay me a visit here the next winter I see no prospect of our meeting shortly. I was interested in the account you gave of Pell (?) unfavorable as it was in some respects. Poor fellow probably he had not as we had pious friends & Pastors (?) to turn his attention to God yet should we pray fervently for him may he not be yet snatched as a brand from the burning. Morris I have strong hopes of -- I think his temper was one easily affected by Religious truth. But poor (illegible) I fear will make this World his (illegible), though God is Gracious and even for him there is a power on High able to wean him from the perishing thongs? of fire?. I feel more everyday the influence of Prayer yet I fear that my practice belies my faith. We are strange creatures, One should suppose that when once a person believes in (illegible) to prayer, he would constantly practice it as an inestimable privilege. But how often does the Christian who knows and has proved it that God hears and blesses his prayer, fail to avail himself of its efficacy [End Page 3] I see there has been serious disturbances in New York about the Abolitionists. Who is Dr. Cox? Is he really as wild and outrageous in his principles and doctrines as the papers make him out? These disturbances growing out of Religion are severe shots to the cause. However that cause is Gods and it has already passed through its most perilous stages -- as I hope. We should be wise as to what is written but this is not enough for many. They must go beyond the Scripture -- However God is the Judge -- and well for us is it, that he is -- for were we constituted into a Tribunal over each other we should probably bring back -- the Rack, the Fire & the Faggot. In our section of the vineyard I hope Religion is making (illegible) -- There is a greater number of intelligent influential men attentive to Religious Duties now than there has been for years. And there is less objection to the Religious instruction of the Colored People than there was formerly. Masters are beginning to number them as portions of their household in a spiritual way. Indeed all who visit us from the North with candis? views are astonished at their Religious Privileges. They are baptized in the Churches before the whole congregation -- they partake of the same cup & the same Bread as their owners and in most congregations they are taught at Sunday School. God bless you dear friend yours W. H. Barnwell Address: Edgar R. Day, Esqr Catskill New York[End Page 4]"
