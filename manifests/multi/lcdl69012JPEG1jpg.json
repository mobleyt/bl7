      "value": "April 12th\nThis morning as I had hoped the postman brought me three envelopes from\nyou and Oh I was thrilled. First darling you do look thin in your \npicture.As beautiful and hansome as ever but you have really lost weight.\nI do wish you would not work on Sunday. It is too much, and you will get\nsick and than lose alot of time in the end. Take care of yourself\nplease darling. Getting overtired, nervousand exhausted never pays.\nIn the end you will get sick and working at all will be agony. Stop be\nfore it is too late, before you have a nervous bre[a]kdown. Remember\none's health comes first, There is nothing on earth more important than\nkeeping well. Try and stop that Sunday work of yours. Mrs Bott would c\ncertainly agree with me. Even tho' there is a war and you have to do the \nlimit of all you can on your job never the less- it will break you\ndown so you and by being useless. The old constitution can only take\nso much and no more.\nYour long letter of April 3rd was wonderful. How I enjoyed\nevery part of it. By now you have received so[m]e of mine telling you \nhow having to join the WAACS has prevented me from going over seas. \nChildren stand in my way and I am here no doubt till the war is over,\nand you return to me which will be such heaven. \nI agree with most everything you say about tho Planation. \nWe will enjoy it for three months perhaps but not all the time. We will \nrun it with w[a]ter and Rosa in a simple kind of way and live somewhere\nin the sunshine to-gether with a house with big windows and lots of \nlight and air. Doodles, and maybe one servant to wash the dishes.\nI agree about letting Melle. go but it is so very hard to make the \nbreak as Landlne told me a week agao how she adored Melle and that never \nnever must I let her go. It will upset her so terribly I hate to do\nit and funnily enough Landine does not like Miss Evans, she said so. \nShe said she is scared of Miss Evans. Rose tells me Miss Evans is not\ncrazy abo[u]t Landine,so I guess they each know tho other does n't care\nmuch for each other- with makes matters awfully difficult. Ofcourse\nsoon Landine will be older- and it will be much easier. I wish it was\nboarding school time right now. I talked this all over with Miss,Charlotte\nand she advised me to leave this a s they are for the time if,I could\nand if financially I could still swing it,as she thought it was not the\nmoment for the wrench. I feel she knows children so much better than I do\nthat I am tempted to be guided in a way by her. What do you think?\nNow that you tell me your Captain wrote a swell letter\nrecommending you two- I can now see where that Commander the other night\ngot the dope that you two were such stars. It has evidently traveled.\naround the Navy Department in short order. I am so glad. I know you two\nare too good for the Job. You two can do anything. Absolutely anything,  \nand I believe before the war is over you will have a much more important\npost. I am sure of it. I certainly hope so.\nDarling I did not say five hundred cables a day. I get \nin 100-a day but put five hundred cover sheets on them. Because there \nare five copies of every cable that I have to rout to different\n[End Page 1]\n2\ndesk heads. It is a busy days work and there is little time to breathe.\nRemember I told you I had an assistant, a secretary and two stenographer\ns plus a messenger boy- all under me at My Cable Desk. It keeps us \nall six busy for nine hours or ten every day. The volume mounts all the\ntime and soon I shall have to take on an other worker to handle the\ngrowing business. Its far and away the most fun of any part of the offi\nas you g[e]t all the red hot news, all the dope, and it takes speed and a\naction which suits me down to the ground. So far I am the only girl\non this floor that has not had a day off because ef sickness. I \nget tired- sure but I seem to sleep ten hours every now and again and \ncome back fresh as a daisy. Its a pity with my health and endurance wh\n[which I can see is far greater than most gals] that I have not got\nsomething to do like driving an ambulance at the front. I would be g\ngood at that am sure, and wish it was what I was doing right now.\nYou would really feel you were helping those poor guys in a big way\nand really doing something. This work is all remote control.\nPlease Darling when and if your plans change let me know. I\nshall be right here I am sure an 1528 31st Street waiting for your\nletters.\nI am so sorry you are getting so tired and overworked-Please\ntry and take care of yourself and get a rest and change on Sunday\n-It really does n't pay to over do it. You know it too.\nDid you ever get my flowers to cheer your apartment. Yours ar\narrive regularly and are so lovely and gay and its such a thrill\nto open them and know they are from you sweet ears. Its heaven. \nI love you and miss you and long to hold you and kiss you.\nSo long darling. I must stop as I have so much work to do.\nGertie -\nP.S. Believe me there would be little chance of Rose going to London\nwith me at any time. Its an believably difficult thing to get\nto London or anywhere and unless you have specific job it cant be done.\nRationiing in England is severe and no extra mouths are wanted to feed.\nOf course I would want her with the children any way -\nShe is so marvelous - I dont know how\nthe house would ever run with out her -\nShe cooks, orders, washes, cleans [and] takes care of\neverything [and] keeps things looking so nice\n[and] neat - I wish you were in my\nlittle house - you would love it so -\nIt is cozy [and] gay [and] clean, [and] the garden\nrun is cunning with the daffodils\nblooming -\n[End Page 2]"
