      "value": "POPUATION HERE  IMC  170,000   for   metropolitan  Area, 200,000 in County  Among Estimates  Increases in bank clearances, posta receipts, mail deiveries, water,  eectric and gas meters, bus passengers and construction point to  a population of between 150,000 and  170,000 persons in Charlestons  metropolitan area and 175,000 to  200,000 in the entire county.  The Commissioners of Public  Works report that as of February 1,  a tota of 15,421 water taps were  instaed, of Which 13,213 are in use.  Water service is given only in the  city proper and a limited area north  of the city. Normay, it is figured  that four persons use one tap, but  under present congested conditions  it is estimated by the commission  that eight persons use each tap,  gliving a tota of 105,704 persons in  the area served by the waterworks.  The number of taps in use February  1 was ninety-one more than the  tota in use as of January 1.  In the Charleston area, the South  Carolina Power complany had a tota of 21,060 eectric meters in use,  of which 17,729 were residential,  and 9,617 gas meters, of which 8,846  were residential. Gas service is confined to the city imits and a very  small  area  north  of the  city.  Federal officias, on a recent visit  to the city to survey housing conditions, estimated the population of  the city itself- was 85,000 persons,  compared to 71,275 by the 1940 census. Their estimate was that . the  present population outside the city  is approximatey 70,000.  Fostoffice Estimate  The postoffice, traditionay conservative in its estimates because of  the constant checks it undergoes,  recenty has estimated a population  of 175,000 in the county. These  figures are based on the number of  mail carriers empoyed, the estimated number of persons in each  famiy, based on carriers\" reports  on every house, apartment and possible stop, the number of rura  ; boxes and the number of the tran-  | sient Public using the general de-   ivery.  mail volume now is double what  it was two years ago, with daiy  canceings varying between 60,000  and 90,000 etters, instead of 30,000.  Bank cearings in 1941 totaed  $93,312.40, compared to $69,919,460  for 1940, a gain of 33 1-3 per cent.  Posta receipts for 1941 totaed  $468,624, compared to $89,402 for  1940, a 21 per cent increase.  Workers for the 1941 city directory, now competing their enumerating task, estimate the population of the area covered by that  volume at between 160,000 and 170,-  000 persons. \"  Not a Vacant House  Charleston, traditionay one of  the most densey popuated cities  in the Unted States, now has not a  singe vacant house. HotTses buit  for one family are now occupied  by from two to twenty famiies.  New homes and apartment houses  are rented as soon as bueprints are  competed.  The Medica Society of South  Carolina, in drawing plans for the  new seven-story Roper Hospital,  which is to be buit at a cost of  about $600,000, based its figures on  an estimated population for the  metropolitan area of more than  150,000.  It was pointed out that the number of empoyes at the Charleston  navy yard would go to 25,000 persons; that the payro of the  Charleston Shipbuiding and Dry-\"  dock complany has grown tremendousy, and the added payro of  the Pittsburgh Metaurgica complany has come here. The West Virginia Pup and Paper complany\"s  plant is working twenty-four hours  a day.  A   $2,000,000   housing  project   a-  ; ready is under way by the V Hous-  | ing corporation, capitaized at $600,-  j 000.  Four  Public  housing  projects,  aggregating   2,660   family   units   to  cost an estimated $6,480,000, are expected to get under way in a tew  days to suppy housing for Chares-  \" ton\"s    navy    yard    and    industrial  plants, many of whose workers now  are traveing more than fifty miles  daiy to their work.  These incude: 2,000 units at  North Charleston, $5,000,000; 500  units on the Ashley river road,  $500,000; 100 Additional units to Tom  McMian Homes, $300,000, and sixty Additional units to Meeting  Street manor. $180,000.  Housing Units in Use  with competion of these projects  Charleston   will   have   more   than  5,350 Public  and semi-Public housing units in use.  The Charleston Shipbuiding and  Drydock complany now is engaged  in a $3,500,000 explansion program  and construction of eight seagoing  tugs at a cost of $10,800,000. Condemnation proceedings were instituted in the Federal court Friday to  acquire and for further explansion.  A contract is expected to be  awarded in a few days for construction of a new School in School  District 4, north of the city, where  children now are having double  sessions as cassroom space is not  \". otherwise avaiable. Another nigh  | School in the same area is awaiting  a defense Public works aotment  and plans have been drawn for  more than a haf dozen other  schoos in the same area.  The   Charleston   airport,   recenty  was modernized, enlarged and improved, by the war department tor  the United States civi aeronautics  authority. Another airport, simiar  in equipment and even more accessibe to the city, is being buit on  John\"s Island. A third auxiiary airport is avaiable on James Island.  Two new theaters are under construction in Charleston and two re-  ecenty have been competed in the  suburbs, north of the city,  To care for explanding, population north of the city, Idditiona  waterworks and sewer facilities are  being instaed as fast as abor,  money and materias become avaiable. \n\n[End Page 1]\nEVENING   POST,   Charles  Charleston  RANKS 129TH  2  Among Cities of United  States, on Basis of the  1940 Census Figures  Charleston, with a population of  71,275 is the 129th largest city in the  United States, figures compied by  the bureau of the census shown.  The rating is based on the 1940  census taken last Apri. Since then,  however, the city has increased in  size through the llarge infux of defense workers empoyed at the navy  yard and at other estabishments.  The Bureau of the census reports  that Greenvie is the 287th largest  city with a population of 34,734, Columbia with 62,396 is the 156th, and  Spartanburg, with 32,294, is the 314th  city of the country.  Augusta, Ga., one of Charlestons  sister cities, with a population of 65-  919 is the 238th largest city; Jacksonville, Fa., with 173,065 inhabitants is the 137th: Charlotte, N. C,  with 100,899 people, is the 171st, and  wimington, whose population aggregates 33,407 is the 344th largest  city. Savannah, with 95,996, ranks  99th.

Charleston has an indicated population now of 153,000, according  to ration book data. Aso, there are  probably many without these books  Charlestons tota increase exceeded  that of the preceding ten-year period. The rate of increase is more  than five and a haf times the  1930--1940 rate.  The estimate of the increase for  the state as a whole between  Apri, 1940 and September, 1942,  was 55,421.  Richand county had the second  largest increase in popuation, 12,-  559, an increase of neary 12 per  cent. Its rate of increase was over  twice as high as the 1930-1940 rate  of population growth. Greenvie  county with a gain of 9,563 was  third in. numerica increase, but  Hampton with 10.75 per cent increase was third among the counties  in rate  of  increase.  The largest decrease in population  for the period occurred in ancaster county which had 2,936 fewer ration books issued than its 1940  census popuation. McCormick  county, although second in numerica decrease, had the highest proportiona loss of popuation, a decrease of 21.3 per cent between 1940  and 1942. Its rate of decrease was  over nine times the rate for a comparable period of the preceding decade. relatively high rates of decrease also occurred in Jasper, Abbevie, Barnwe, and Dion counties.  There were twenty-four counties  which had a decrease in population  between 1940 and 1942, as compared  with eeven counties which decreased in population between 1930  and 1940. Eight of the eeven counties which ost population during  the 1930-1940 period have continued  to ose population subsequent to  1940. Sixteen of the counties which  have ost population since 1940 had  gained population during the preceding decade, while nineteen counties gained for both the 1930-40 period and since 1940.  The work on the population report was carried out by Juian J.  Petty, planning board consutant.  He said tabuations based on the  war ration books should have an  accuracy comparable to the census. Between 1930 and 1940 the  population increased by 161,039 and  in the period since the 1940 census  it has increased more than the entire growth in the 1920 to 1939 pe  riod.  There were 1,955,227 war ration  books issued in South Carolina up  to September 1, 1942. The population of the state on Apri 1, 1940  was 1,899,804. Thus a population increase of 55,423, or 2.92 per cent is  indicated. The increase for the 1930-  1940 period was 9.3 percent, or at  the rate of 2.25 per . cent for a  twenty-nine month period, the report states.  The more rapid rate of population  increase during recent months does  not indicate much, if any, migration addition to South Carolina\"s  popuation, for during recent years  the excess of birth over deaths in  the state has averaged around 22,-  000 per year and thus the absolute  increase and natura increase for  the last twenty-nine months have  not much more than baanced. During the period that statewide records on births and deaths have been  kept, the natura increase of popuation, that is the excess of births  over deaths, has been greater than  the absolute increase as indicated  by the censusu.  The excess of births between 1920  and 1930 amounted to 236,000 while  the actua gain in population was  only 55,000, and between 1930 and  1940 the excess of births was about  206,000 and the absolute increase  was 161,000. The new population  data appear to indicate that during  recent months .the ong standing  trend of more rapid natura increase that absolute increase has  been stopped if not reversed, Mr.  Petty decared.  while the population figures as  based on the number of war ration books issued may need some  adjustment for compete comparabiity with the census, the data  undoubtedy indicate the general  nature of the more recent population changes which to a considerable extent have been brought about  by the modification of the economy  as a result of the war. \n\n[End Page 3]"
