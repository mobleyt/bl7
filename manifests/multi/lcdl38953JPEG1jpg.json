      "value": "JOS. DANIEL POPE, A. C. HASKELL. Pope & Haskell, ATTORNEYS-AT-LAW. Columbia, S. C., 28th Dec. 1870 James B Heyward Esqr My dear Sir Yours of the 28th has been received. As I wrote you before the case of Elliott vs Jas B Heyward was vigorously defended by us in by Fickling & Pope. We did all we could in the case. They claimed the debt and interest from date up to the 25th Feby 69 the day of the Verdict but [are?] succeeding in cutting down the Amount to $847.41. The other party was very much dissatisfied. You are mistaken in one thing; Mr DeSaussure accepted service for Ym and Ym spoke to me and him. The dd gentleman was very ill at the time (as I now remember it) and the case fell upon me, Mr Fickling being a Witness. Mr F proved most satisfactorily all that you state [End Page 1] The case did not go off on the scaling of the note at all. But the note was considered as representing the rent due for the year and the question was: What was the rent worth? It was proved that no rent had him paid and evidence was introduced to prove the value of the rent &c. The Jury returned a verdict which gave great dissatisfaction to Elliott and Johnson as they wanted good money dollar pr dollar. I wrote to you at the time. I think I directed my letter to Blue House P.O. I have seen [illegible] McMaster and now enclose his statement with interest up to 25 Feby 71. and the costs. I am glad the [payment?] was [illegible] before this informal Code as the costs would have been vastly more. He says he will accept draft in factor accepted 25 Feb 1870. Draw 1st March that will do. I am sorry you have to pay so large an amount but except for vigorous efforts it might have been larger. Thank you for the latter part of your letter. Any thing P&H can do for you now will be cheerfully done Yours Truly Jas Daniel Pope [End Page 2]"
