      "value": "Copy of letter to F. Lynch Charleston S.C. 13 Nov. 1861 Dear Francis In these troublesome times, so rife with panics, a great many as you may suppose are thinking of going to Cheraw as a [illegible] safe place, and yet with ready communication with Charleston and a good many wishing to go there asks me about it -- especially Catholics. Mrs Purcell of Summerville, with her aged and rather invalid sister Miss Ryan, and her daughter Miss Purcell wish to go. Could they get board with Cornelia, or with any one else. They would I presume have one or two servants. I believe they have a few negroes, but they could arrange otherwise for them. Dr. White's wife with Mrs. Posi, wish if possible to get a house to rent, with of course some out houses for servant. Can such a thing be got -- say for a year, and at what rates. Is Augusta coming up -- or is their house to rent. It would I think be jumped at, now. If any of your friends can take boarders, now is their time to let it be known[End Page 1] Mrs Blain and Daughter will soon be forced to come up -- say in a few weeks for as yet no attack is threatened, but I advise them to send their trunk ahead. Mrs Carmand and her daughter are now shopping with them, but they, together with Mrs Rasted, will probably be with Mrs [illegible] on Friday night, unless they learn tomorrow that her terms are entirely too high. They expect she will not charge over $20 a month. If pleaded they will stay a good long time. Perhaps Mrs Chartrand and Mrs Lebleux (both) and Mrs Macomb may follow, but not until the enemy is in sight. If Henrietta gave Mrs Posi [illegible] an opening she would come to board with you -- or with any of the family -- of course paying her way. Tell father not to mind the thousand exaggerated lies and reports that are circulating through the country. The truth is this. The yankess coming with an overwhelming force have taken Port Royal Harbour, the best in the South -- and are busy fixing themselves firmly there. This will take five or six weeks at least, what they[End Page 2] will do then we do not know. Perhaps they will if they think themselves strong enough, try to take Charleston. So far, they have behaved themselves decently, have I believe kept themselves to the islands at the Harbour, -- and have troubled none of the residents (all ran away except one man, -- who I believe has joined them), have burned nothing and as yet taken no negroes. But there are upwards of 2000 within their reach--many of whom they will seduce. It is said, how truly I know not, 50 cents a night for work on the entrenchments and batteries they are making -- but the truth is, none of our people go within ten miles of the place to learn how things are going. Here people were wild with consternation for two or three days, just as I presume they were at Washington, after the battle of Manassas and the most absurd rumors are [illegible]. But today we are comparatively quiet, and feel foolish after our fright. i hope we will have some sense, for it is very necessary in our position. I saw a lady who visited Catherine a fortnight or so ago and found her quite well[End Page 3] She sends love to all and is praying hard for us but says I must not go there. Mrs Blain and Daughter are quite well. My love to Henrietta and the children to Father Mother and Anna and John, and to Cornelia, also to the warriors Hugh & Conlaw. Are they in the same company -- who is captain? Pray for yr Afft Brother PN Lynch D.D. I met Ingraham a few days ago, why, says he, what a h-ll of a fellow for salts your brother must be, writes for a barrel of glauber salts a few days ago, -- sent him one, before, only the other week, who is he doctoring with it? Have you heard from Dr Parks? Dr Hume spoke to me again today about the fennel, has tried it over again with the same results -- failure -- says, if good the patent is not valid, as he can swear that you tried it years age. He gave me the enclosed items from the best Botanist in the State, Do you know the plants -- I scarcely think they grow with you in the up country. However I send it.[End Page 4]"
