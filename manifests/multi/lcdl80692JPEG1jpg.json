Waties\nStatiburg, 2 Feb. 1808\n \nDear Sir,\n\nI have reviewed your favor requesting me and\n[illegible] General Davie [illegible] a copy of the opinion deliver in\nthe case of G[illegible] S. Theus and also copies for yourself and\nWm: Bay: Before I left [illegible] I was solicited by several\ngentlemen of the Bar and permit a publication of it for general\ninformation, which I consented to, and left the opinion [illegible]\nJn. [Desaussane?] and C given and Wm: W. Laughtor Smith who\nhad undertaken and send it to one of the Printers. I expected\nthat by this time the thing had been done, but I suppose that\n[illegible] of more immediate career have occasioned the delay.\nI will write by the and Mr. Smith and request my\nattention to it, for this publication will save me some trouble,\nand [illegible] also I believe produce some public good. The\nsubject is extremely interesting and The whole community, and\nit is particularly important that the gentlemen of the Bar\nshould be made acquainted into the decision in a written\nform, which will leave I hope no room for any further doubts,\nand of course save us from many a troublesome and tiresome\nargument. Be so good and enquire of Mr. D. Saussure\nif he ever delivered the opinion and Mr: Smith. I have no other\n\n[End page 1]\n\ncopy of it.\n\nI must beg you to inform me what is your view of the\nsteps which I will C. advisable for us to pursue toward\nNicholson. Would enter arbitration answer? I am inclined\nto think that this would be the best mode, if he will agree that three\nGentlemen of the law, who have had as concern built the old\nterm bills, shall settle our differences. I would prefer that\na fee should be made up for them  by both parties as a com-\npensation for their trouble. If I will but accede \nto this mode, there is no other claim to file a bill to compel him\nto account. I think you would determine if the [illegible]\nto be adopted, with which I shall C. perfectly and\nI will only observe Act if the settlement is bound [illegible]\ndelayed, we may as well give up our claims altogether.\nI am dear Sir,\nYours, Very sincerely,\nTho. Waties\n\n[End page 2]\n\nStateburg S.C.\nFebruary 4, 1808\n\n[To:] Hoble [Honorable] Judge Grimke\nCharleston\n\n[End page 3]"
