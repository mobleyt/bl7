      "value": "March 6, 1944\nHey Hey Nuts,\nHer[e] we are in our new aoartment and very fine\nit is with the red rugs, redplush furniture and heavy dark\nfurniture. What could be more attractive in a tropical\nclimate. The heat farely exudes from every thing so that\nlittle waves dance up and down and the morriors reflect the\nthin haze that lies over the red assemble like a blanket of\nsmoke. Sunday was the moving day. Morris went to the office\nand told me to start moving immediately. He returned at noon\nand was am[a]zed that I had not moved evert[h]ing without the\nhelp of a car or anything else. From then on until five thirty\nI carried great loads up to the apartment, my back bowed with\ntheir weight and my brow covered with xxxxx sweat. The Fuherer\nsat in the apartment and gave me directions as to where to put\nmy burdens as he said that someone had to direct the work.\nFinely everything was moved and I lay down on my bed with a sigh\nof relief thinking that thoughX I was to tired to sleep I could\nat least lieand rest. But no, the Fuherer had opened up all the\nscreens to let in the heavelny sunlight and the mosquitos not\nrealizing that it was only for the sunlight had poured in too.\nWhen morning came I was pinpricked with little red dots so that\nit looked as If I had contracted the plague or was half leopard.\nBut all in all the aprtment is very attractive. It is way up\nin the air, has a porch off my bed room, another one off the\nliving room, great big windows, and is filled with sunshine,\nbreezes and soft air day and night. There is a wonderful\nfeeling of space after our little apartment, which though it \nwas most attractive and far better furn[i]shed than this one now,[it]\nseems to have been tiny and not worthy of our great personages.\nThis [one] neverless needs someone like Rose to lend a helping hand.\nThere are all these little things that she would seize upon and\ndissappear for a morning shopping only to reappear with the\nnecseesitires that make the difference between an ordinary and\nan attractive place. Of course there is the small matter of\nbringing me coffee in bed, Of this I will not spea[k] for it seems\nlike a dream those days when Lizzie would ascend the steps and\ndeposit on my knee a tray groaning with eggs and bacon and I\nwould gorge and then roll over and fall asleep[,]almost ahead of you[,]\nwho woud be preten[d]ing that you were reading the morning paper\nwhen I could hear the snore[s]ascending from behind this unworthy\nscreen.\nAS A RESULT OF ALL THIS ACTIVITY [no reason for capitals\nthe machine just stuck] I missed my swim and sun bath, but did\nnot really care because lately the water has been so covered with\noil that it is not a pleasure to go in. The last time I bathed\nthe tar stuck to me in great globs and I had to take a sponge bath\nwith tuppontentine to regain my natural hue and not look like a\npickanany on theplanatati[o]n. It is especailly difficult to get it\noff when it mixes in your hair. Then you have strange little\n[End Page 1]\ntop xxxs knots that stand straight in the air and stiff curls that\nlook something like the ones you had in Windhoek when the coiffeur\nfinished with you there. There was a greet sight. Your hair\nstanding stiff and straight and your anger so great at the\nindignity committed upon you that your face was absolutle y red\nand all you could do was to splutter. My how I laugued.\nJohnny Fell was going to come out and have a drink with me and\ndinner the other evening but was unable to at the last moment.\nHowever I hope he will wander out one of these days so we can talk\nabout the old days at palm beach and the life that was a life.\nThe thing that has given us the biggest laugh yet out here\nis that in the last Time it spoke of what men had to do out on\nthe warring fronts. Movies are the great thing the article went\non, men will sit in the pouring rain wactching the screen, yes\nlife on the far flung outpost where life is lived in the raw such\nas at ----- and it gave the name of this place with several others\nThis gave us all a big kick because we are so much safer than\nwe would be in New York that there is no comparison as you well\nknow. Now I read continually that the Germans are ginving you\nhell and that I think you are in a certain amount of danger.\nNevertheless I really believe that the greatest darger lies in\nto many dinner parties rather than too many bombs.\nArmant has gone to stay with Fifi in San Mateo until\nhis ship sails. Olive will come from New Orleans and then\nmotor the car back. What they are doing with a car out there is\nbeyond me but there you are. They will undobtly have a wonderful\ntime and Edith will have to unlimber that old arm of hers and\nplay a little tennis provivding Armant is able to unlimber his\nknee suffieciently enough to shuffle around the court. When he\narrives with us there will be the most distinughied gathering of\ncrooks that has ever been known. We will hoist a flag[,] Legendre\nL[y]ing In Hospital above our door and all the world can pay five\ncents and see us in our glass coffins, breathing but too tired to\nmove exxcept to eat and drink.\nHowever do not get to full of yourself and think that\nI am done andfinished because I will always beat you at\ngames[,]because everyone knows you are too fat to play.\nGoodbye darling I wish we could be playing together now.\nAll my love.\nSidney Legendre\n[End Page 2]"
