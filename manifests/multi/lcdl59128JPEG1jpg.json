      "value": "SURVEY OFF-STREET  PARKING  F ACUITIES  Mrs. Harry M. Rubin, Chairman  This survey of off-street parking areas is only a first step in  the process of securing an accurate picture of avaiable parking  facilities in Charleston.  In many places the proprietors had no  idea, of the size of their parking areas; some made a rough estimate  others made no attempt to give a figure: only two, Connoey\"s  Storage Garage and Kerrison\"s Parkway, were interested enough to  take actua measurements and ca, the soicitor to suppy the  information.  The survey reveas:  2 commercial garages with a capacity of 212 cars and fees from  25 cents per day or $5.00 per month for daytime parking to  75 cents a night or $15.00 a month for night parking. [Ameida\"s  Garage, and Connoey\"s Storage garage 24,300 sq. ft.]  6 commercial parking lots were found with a tota car capacity  of 426 cars; an estimate of 830 cars use these lots a day paying  ah average fee of 15 cents with a three hour imit. [Brown\"s  Parkway; Kerrison\"s Parkway 9000 sq..ft.; Charleston Parking ot;  Academy Parking ot; George Street Parkway 86,000 sq. ft.;  Market and Hayne Service Station.]  1 icensed traier court with an estimated area of 12,360 so.ft.  has a capacity of 10 traiers and 12-14 cars with a fee of 15  cents for three hours or $3.00 a month. [Burns Lane Parkway]  7 firms maintain parking areas for customers for which no fees  are chlarged.  No check is made on cars using these areas so  a figures are rough estimates or wid guesses: estimated  car capacity totas 447; estimated use 1037. [Condon\"s, Big  Star [uptown], Big Star [downtown], Francis Marion Hote,  Argye Hote 3750 sq.ft., Krawcheek\"s 1750 sq.ft., Scobie\"s]  In addition, many service stations, garages, and used car  deaers permit limited parking privieges to friends or customers  but only a few chlarge a fee for this service.  A number of firms  have small ares for use of employees ony, and the county maintains  an area on Marion Square for use of employees and visitors in the  County Center.  There is also a parking area used by Miitary  Police and Shore. Patro personne.  In this summary no figures have been included for the usua  service stations, repair garages, car deaers, or for employee  only areas although survey banks for many were turned in by the  soicitors and are included with this materia.  Soicitors were secured through the metropolitan Council to  whom our appreciation is extended. \n\n[End Page 1]\nIn areas 1 and 2 there is only one commercial parking garage,  Comnoey\"s, with a capacity of 200 cars; fees can be arranged by  the day or month.  In these areas are three parking lots maintained by private industries for customers: Francis Marion Hote,which reports their  area whoy inadequate for their needs; Condon\" Department Store:  Big Star Grocery.  None chlarges a fee, keeps a check on a rivas  or departures, or knows its square foot area.  Figures on these  were in each instance a rough estimate.  There are also a few fiing stations in which a limited number of  ears are permitted to park free of chlarge.  And one vacant ot on  St.Phiip Street which a negro man apparenty uses as a source of  small change.  Miss Rosa Hornik, Carolina Art asocialtion member,assisted me by  using her car to take me through my territory.   \n\n[End Page 2]"
