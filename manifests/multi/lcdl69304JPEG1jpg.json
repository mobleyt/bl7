      "value": "12\nOctober 3, 1942\nGertie Darling, \nWhat a wonderful afternoon. Three of your letters\narrived[,]8,9,10. I was so excited that I did not know which one to\nopen first. Then when I did and found them so full of news and\nyour own sweet self I almost cried with pleasure. Your life sounds\nterrible at night and I wish I was there to cheer you and give you\na hundred big fat kisses. However I think you are doing marvellous\nwork in your office and I am very proud of you. I am only sorry\nyou have to work so hard. \nPlease do not worry about the poaching at Medway.\nThat seems so far away from me, and scmehow that life appears to\nne a litt1e unreal and artificial, and devoid of interest. I\ndon't think we will ever want to burden ourselves with plantation\ntroubles again, rather I want to live with you by the sea in the\nsun[s]hine sorrounded by flowers , and to hell with all those pouting\nspoiled negroes and the poachers that are continually overunning\nones land and ruining our rides because we always are hearing their\nshots.\nGertie my job is not a big job. It is tiny and not\nin anyway important. Unfortunately this is true, and I do not see\nany change in the future. What I said about the possibility of\nleaving this job was that men are always being detached from this\noffice for air duty, four more are leaving very soon. No one\nknows who will be next, and it might as well be me as anyone.\nThe set up is such that air is the most important part of our\nwork and as a result even if one does not know anything about it\n[End Page 1]\nis presumed that you do. Morris and I are administrative officers,\nand our job is to run the office and personnel. This means everything\nfrom seeing there is a sufficent amount of paper and paper clips\nto seating the officers, opening all mail and routing it, securing\ntransportation dictating all official correspondence etc. It\nis nothing but a secretaries job , and probably the first girl you\nbump into on [C]onstitut1on avenue could do the job better than.I can[,]\nIt is interesting only in that it keeps me very busy as there\nis always someone who wants something in a great hurry[,]and then\neither Morris or I cling to the telephone and dial energetically\ndrying to get the department that will do it. Tomorrow is our day\noff as it is Sunday and we were looking forward to it as we both\nhave lousy colds. However the Admiral decided to make an inspection\nand as we are responsible for the appearance of the office we will\nhave to be here. I hope he will be satisfied and not tell me\nto scrub the deck.\nDoyou remember a man called Hennings, very attractive,\nwe crossed with him on the [O]lympic the year we were married. He\nis here now and recognized me the other day[,] which I think is\namazing as we had not seen one another since that time and that was\nthirteen years ago. He talked about Pat Roarke and Tremaine, and\nfrom somewhere in my mind I thought I remembered that Tremaine\nwas ki_lled at Dunkerque and told him so. Is that correct.\nHennings was Rex Tugwells aide in Puerto Rico, and you may remember\nreading an article about him in time two years ago. He helped me\na great deal the other day taking me around to see various officers\nthat I would have found it difficult to contact without him, and\ntalking to him about the old Olynpic brought back all the memories \n[End Page 2]\nof being with you. Do you remember the fun we had, and the\nthrills. It all seems just like yesterday to me and I find myself\nsmilling sonetimes at my work when I think of it. \nToday is [S]unday and we are at the office waiting for the\nAdmiral to make his inspection. Morris looks as if he is going\nto die he has such a bad cold and sore throat. They have given\nhim sulfa something or xother pills to take and he says they make\nhim feel even worse. I refused to take them for my cold and do not\nbelieve I am any worse off. I wish the old man would come so I\ncould go home[,] but he probably will not show up until late this\nafternoon. Everything is spick andspan now but by then the dust\nwill have blown over all the desk and there will be bits of paper\non the floor. \nWe now have to black out at 7.30 and cannot turn\nour lights on until 6;45 in the morning so I am graudally learning\nto live like a mole and by the time the war is over will only\nbe able to blink whe[ne]ver I face strong light. The other evening\na gas station had forgotten to turn its neon lights out at seven\nthirty and there was an immense-crowd around the light ahing and\noh-ing about how wonderful it was. Really it was extraordinary how\ngay it seemed, you do not realise how much you live in the darkness\nuntil you see something like this. Anyway Morris the goodSmaritian\nclimbed up and disco_nnectedthe light and the crowd booed because\nthey did not care if the owner would be fined $100 bucks as long\nas they could see the light for a little while.\nThe wild smoke turkey that you are sending\nus for thanksgiving sounds marvellous. But please do not think\nthe food here is bad. It is very good, and all that one can eat.\nI have not weighed since I left America but I know that I have not\n[End Page 3]\nlost , and certainly the seat of my trousers has broad[e]ned as a\nresult of so much sitting.\nNone of your letters are censored, nd I do not believe\nthat mall from the mainland is. Only what we send out from here\nis opened and read. This is what c[A]sues the delay sometimes.\nHowever what I can not understand is how one day you will receive\na letter from me that has only taken four days and thena_nother\ntime it will take 15 days.\nI was so amused about [B]en's immenient departure. I\nwould not worry my sweet about Carola going to England until you\nhear she has gone. England seems so far away out here and we\nget only the mostfragmentary reports about the Russian war. I\nhave not seen the word Meditaranean for weeks so do not even know\nwhether the Libyian campaign is still on or whether it is finished.\nThe war with Japan is the one source of military conversation I hav[e]\nheard and I have not heard a great deal about that. Certainly not\nhalf asmuch as Iwould read in Time or Life. I am afraid that I\ncannot see the woods for the trees, and that I know more about\npaper clips thaxn I do about the armed forces.\nWhen you put in your call on Susday the 11th. please\ntell theoperator youwant to speak to me at either 1 PM or 8 or 6AM.\nAs I told you in my last letter they called me at ten thirty and\nas a result I sat in my room waiting. Not that I mind this but\nit seemed so indefininte [as] I did not know when you would really\ncall. Certainlyif I am transferred I will call you, but do not\nthink I will be able to tell you where I am going or any plans,\naxs that would be against the censorship. My hotel [telephone] number is\n9934. There is no exchange out here you just give that numbgr to\n[End Page 4]\nthe operator and you will get the hotel. Then my room number is\n15-1, but that is not necessary as the hotel oeprator will connect\nme with you. I can hardly wait to speak to youagain even though\nwe are unable to say anything that makes sense.\nIt is now noon and the Admiral has not come yet. I guess\nhe will not turn up today at all. It does'nt bother me however,\nI have become very fatalistic which isthe samething as lazy, and if\nI had taken the day off I probably would have been burned too\nmuch by the sun or someth[i]ng else would have happeneded.\nMorris thanks youso muohh for wishing him a happy\nbirthday and will start wishing you one now in order that it may\narrive in time.\nGoodbye dear, I send you all my love\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 5]"
