Cimate and geographica ocation of Charleston,  Industry and tourists.  population increased due to war condition 25  in city,  30 in suburbs.  Geographica situation of Charleston indicates depreciating  and values in center of city.  Cas for city planning whether centraization or decentraization.  In decentralization and in center of city becomes sums.  In centraisation plans must be made for ocation of businesses, industry and traffic circuation  prevailing winds, navigable waters govern ocation of heavy industry  Active zoning aw most important - must be predicated on  thorough research and study for physical growth and development.  Parks, playgrounds and bouevards essentia for maintaining  property values.  There must be some areas in the city that do not pay their  own way where the revenues from depreciated values do not meet city services expenses. This poses vita problem of maintenance of city government.  Statistics Show for year 1939-40 a tota value of goods produced by Industry $31,000,000 - tota receipts of retai stores  $32,000,000 - 300,000 tourists spent approximatey $13,000,000 on  basis of $15 per day, average of 3 days stay.  old and historic buildings as defined in book This is Charleston distinct asset to city and increased tourist trade.  planning and Zoning Commission hired Morris Knowes of Pittsburgh to made physical survey of city in 1931. \n\n[End Page 1]\n-2-  The Civic Services Committee of the Carolina Art  Association started in 1940 to carry on work of preservation of physical attributes of Charleston, Empoyed Frederick Olmstead to make a piot  study for guidance in carrying on this work, and from 1940 on, the Civic Services Committee has compied statistics and data keeping Morris Knowes survey up to date and enarging upon statistica  data necessary for a thorough understanding of the problems invoved in the future development of Charleston.  In order that the buildings of esthetic value might be known, the Civic Services Committee recenty pubished the book This Is Charleston.   From other studies which the Committee has undertaken oyer the past two years, it was realized that traffic congestion in the downtown business section was of primary importance. To aeviate this congestion and so that the property values in this area might be maintained, the Committee developed preliminary drawings and studies for a system of off-street parking lots behind the business estabishments on both sides of King Street from Calhoun to Queen. Due to the various eements which entered into ths probem, such as traffic contro, poicing, ighting, and liability, it was eary determined that this must be a municipal project.  These preliminary studies were presented to the City Council in March and were very favoraby received. At the request of City Counci, the Civic Services Committee is continuing this study so that it may be resubmitted in greater detai so that costs of property and improvements necessary may be accuratey known. It is  hoped to resubmit this study to the City Council in compete form by September 15th at which time it will be turned over to the City Engineer for further action, if so desired.  It is the hope of the Civic Services Committee that their proonged studies and coected data will be of use to the city or those agencies within the city interested in planning for the future, and the Civic Services committee and its taff will wecome the opportunity to work with any group or agency for the development of the future of Charleston  and the Civic Services Committee and   taff Hi   t i t;- i   b te  opportunity to with any group or agency fo- t 3 development-of  the future of Charleston\n\n[End Page 2]\nOUTINE:SOME SPECIFIC problems DEMANDING COOPERATIVE ACTION.
