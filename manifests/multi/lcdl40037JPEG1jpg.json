I have written to Brother Fowles & mentioned that you would probably come by the way of Walterboro & depend upon his bringing you to Beaufort-- which I have not the slightest doubt he will gladly do. I remember how you are circumstanced-- but I trust the Lord will enable You, notwithstanding, to come. I shall earnestly look for you. I should have put off the meeting till the following week-- but that is court-week & many will be called away-- & by the week after that many of my people will probably be going to the country. Do then my Dear Brother [illegible: page torn] an effort to attend-- & come [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: page torn] [spirit?] of the Lord Jesus-- [illegible: hole in page] [illegible: hole in page] your praying people to remember us.
