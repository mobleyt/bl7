I mailed these all by different routes and please say in your next which arrive the quickest. I write you now simply in reference to my plans. No one can be more anxious than I am to return to you all & to [illegible] to help what I [illegible]. Sometimes I almost make up my mind to leave certainly in October but my mission here if I may so call it is not completed. Of course it required some time to make myself sufficient master of the German language, to [illegible] on all my studies in it so that I can only call myself a 6 months scholar in Hebrew -- and am just at a point when it is important to have all assistances at hand. Then too I am beginning to be largely acquainted with German theology, its errors & its new [illegible] development. It will be very useful to me in the every day walks of ministerial life not to [illegible] the vast [In crosshatch]: I should a sapping of my zeal in the practical duties of the ministry. My temperament will give me [illegible] in any sphere and God I trust will give me Grace whenever there is a patch of [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] if it be [illegible] & [illegible] and the [voice?] of the lord shall call saying whom shall I send. May I be ready to respond \"Here am I send me.\" The way seemed opened to me to come here & I came. If the hand of Providence beckons me back far be from me to [illegible] a deaf ear. T have hitherto said little of plans. Now you[End Page 1] importance which an acquaintance with those views and Christian principles which have deluged Europe and are sweeping wildly over America as they are their source [illegible] [illegible] to me as a minister or a contributor to the press. Germany is setting itself right again as to the Bible and will furnish us with the weapons for conquering the \"heresies\" it self has given birth to. I am pursuing a connection with my Hebrew [illegible], Biblical & evangelical studies preparing material for sermons &c to lighten my labour for the future. [illegible] this would not be sufficient to justify me in staying if I had not the means. I will tell you frankly how I stand. I have not yet touched the 453. + 100. +25$ which Papa owes me, have drawn however 100$ from Uncle R. & will draw no more. This you know, though intended as a present, I consider as a loan. Aunt Betsy was kind enough to give me 200. last & the same this [In crosshatch]: knowable. In conclusion give me not simply your daily prayers those I know I have. For daily prayers for the blessing of my studies to my more spiritual [illegible] and the furtherance of Xtn Kingdom on earth. My prayers ever for you all. Gods providence has indeed worked mysteriously in our midst. His [illegible] be [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] behind the [illegible] into can say what good things await those that trust in his mercy & truth. Papas trials are indeed severe & keen but so have his measures of grace been abundant and overflowing. How many departed souls have[End Page 2] year. Aunt Mathews 189 last year. With this I have made out to get along very well and hope not to be obliged to draw on any of what Papa owes me before the winter (if then). My desire is not to use it at all but to let it stand for any contingency which may befall. My longer stay in Europe will then depend upon a project which I have in vision. It is to work up some material for the press, which will combine 3 things--(1) advance in my own studies (2) Beneficial to the Xtn public in America and (3) give me some 1 or 200$ free. This will carry me through safely. I will probably return home in Mr T's Vessel as he assured me it cost him nothing & was simply a convenience. I told you he [illegible] his offer in person last spring and also kindly wrote a letter to Havre & Liverpool, ordering his agents to pledge me any sums I needed. Mr. Geo Coffin also gave me a letter containing a draft of 500$ to be used in case of need.

Should I discontinue my \"book preparations\" I will return home. Should I be encouraged I will remain. I must confess I am sometimes low-spirited about all & everything & feel very restless about my being here. I try to work off the feeling in redoubled exertions to improve my time but impatience will spoil any work. You must not think I am overworking myself though -- more labor is but not half the worry that awaits me at home in the ministry. I know I am born to it as naturally as the sparks fly upward, or as the Hebrew beautifully expresses \"as the children of the burning coal are borne aloft\" -- but can I not add with [illegible]. \"Well then I will sink into God and to God I will commit [thy?] cause?\" To Uncle R. first, Aunt Betsy, Aunt Mathews I am indebted for all the advantages which I here enjoy. May their gifts be not unto me but unto the Lord. I do not fear so much as perhaps[End Page 4]"
