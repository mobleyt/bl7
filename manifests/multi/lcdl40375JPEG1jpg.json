Phil, however has been as cool as one could wish-- oweing perhaps to the rain. I have written several letters home and have received one from Bet dated August 11th. She says they are in Mr Chisholms house which is a delightful one although Small-- 6 rooms only I think. She does not mention Charley or Mamma so that I suppose them better. I see by the Papers 200 persons have died in NY. in three days. We have heard from Aunt Meta. She has it seems determined on staying at Cape May longer. There is a letter here for you which I enclose. I Enjoy the quiet here so much that I will not return to the hotel life until next week. I will leave here Monday or Tuesday unless I hear from you in the mean time-- if however you wish me to come sooner-- let me hear. Mr Flanders and Aunt Bet and also Elliott are well[End Page 1] Mr F. as Kind as possible. We have been to several of the libraries and also [illegible] to Western Phil-- one of the pleasantest villages I have ever seen-- -- -- -- All send their love-- Your affectionate Son Edward Barnwell August 18th/53[End Page 2] Revd William H Barnwell Tuscarora Pnn--[End Page 3]"
