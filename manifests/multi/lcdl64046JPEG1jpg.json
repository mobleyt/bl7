      "value": "Blue House South Ca. Combahee Dec. 27. 1834 My dear gSon Your letter of the 14 [?] is before me, just received. The \"necessary of life\" being the 1st object, I hasten to say, that my letter is prepared for Ladson [and] Co. to remit to you quickly a draft on some Merchant in Boston for four hundred dollars. This draft you are to present yourself, and do your own business. Be careful now, that you are not robbed. It will be safest for you, not to keep all your money under one cover, or in the same place. I suppose eight hundred dollars per an. payable half yearly, [or quarterly if you choose] from the 1st Jan 1835 will be a full allowance. I am much gratified to find that you are so actively engaged in your studies. Social pleasure is desirable, and commendable; but be careful not to let this run into dissipation with doubtful companions. I wish to see you return to Ca. a practical scholar, a gentleman, and not a \"book worm.\" It happens that Wm. Henry is at Combahee for the time of his vacation, and being at home, I presented him with your letter, as you desired. He remarked that you were sharp upon him. He is not [End Page 1] offended. Your rebuke may be of service to him. Nat is at Combahee also, and is doing very well in Beaufort, with Mr. R. Barnwell and the office. I give you a hint about Tom. F. I do not like him. Nor is he a desirable friend. Tho' it would be proper for, country sake, to keep up a distant acquaintance. hush! H. Read will be a safe and honorable companion, perhaps too pompous, as yr. family. It has not perhaps reached you, that Mr. Blake Senr. died in Savannah on the 9 Dec. aged 58. He leaves a heavy debt in Geo. which is likely to consume the Geo. Estate. My daughter-in-law Louisa has added a gSon to my stock. I annex your Church certificate agreeable to your wishes, to which I hope you will steadily adhere I am Your's Affectionately Nath. Heyward [End Page 2] Blue House [right corner:] 25 Dec 28th 1834 James B Heyward Cambridge Massachusetts [End Page 3]"
