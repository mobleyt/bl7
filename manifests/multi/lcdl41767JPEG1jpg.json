      "value": "JMJ Ursuline Convent Columbia S.C. Jan 23rd 1862 My dearest Brother, Although I had not leisure to write to you by Revd A McNeal, & therefore should not expect you to do so. I felt a little disappointed on his return to hear nothing from you. I wrote to you when you were in Cheraw asking you for an Ordo for this year which I understand you to say was published in Charleston, but I suppose I must have been mistaken, or you perhaps did not get my letter on your return. I am so glad you went to see father at that time, it did him so much good. Anna says he is now able to walk out about the garden. I took the liberty of requesting Mr Seigling (?) to call on you for money which we owe him for hire of a harp & some sheet music, I thought it would not inconvenience you, & I can pay you more conveniently[End Page 1] when you come up, then I could send it to him. You would also oblige me very much by paying Mr B ONeill $29.57 which we owe him for rice & hops, that he sent us, & which I am ashamed to say, I never acknowledged the receipt of, owing partly to forgetfulness, partly to press o& other duty &c. We have just got or rather John got for us, a barrell of best N.O. molasses at 60cts per gal -- whereas I see that you paid B_ Oneill 62 -- for an article perhaps not as good, & have freight to pay besides. We have another little boarder in the person of Miss Lyles of Richmond Va -- the little girl about whom her parents wrote some time since, & about whose coming I threw cold water upon. Well, she is here -- a nice little thing, a Protestant. Her father is quarter-master in the Army on the Potomac. We frequently hear from Mrs Blanchard & even the Genrl whose daughter has had the measles but is now quite well. Several of our pupils are suffering from colds & their effects, which gives Sr Augusta (?) something to do -- & yesterday we had three sick sisters,[End Page 2] but although inconvenient, it was nothing serious. What do you think of the present state of the country, & how should effect the arrangements of our school. Shall I begin as usual to arrange things with a view to the Distribution? This is the time we generally begin to do so, & I would be glad to know what you would think it best to do. If we have a distribution, the children must devote their time & the Sisters too, to studying Duets &c &c. But if not it would be better for them, & more satisfactory to their Parents, to make a different arrangement of their studies. John & family are quite well, he has lost several patients with Dyptheria, but they were young children I think. Good night - it is just ten OClock - I wish you a comfortable night's rest. I wonder how poor Hugh[End Page 3] is getting on down the coast? It takes some of the comfort out of the fire & bed, when I think of his exposure. I do hope he may not get sick while down there. Please pray for us all & give you benediction, especially to Ellen & myself. Your own Sister Ellen Sr Baptiste[End Page 4]"
