      "value": "Beaufort. Septr 3d 1832-- My. dear Day. You see I have allowed two days in this month to pass without writing according to our arrangement; It makes no real difference as it happens, for your Mail leaves this Place but three times in the week; though to say the truth the delay in this instance arose from my forgetting, not yourself, or your letter, but the day of the Month. But enough of excuses-- they consume time and paper which can I hope be more profitably and agreably employed. The account you gave me, of the answer to Prayer in the happy end of your cousin in New York, was truly interesting. What a merciful God have we whose ears are ever open to the cry of Sinners like us; but yet how strong and clear are his promises to hear and answer fervent, humble Prayer! and when we reflect that all of \"his promises are in Christ. yea and Amen.\" and that if Christ is ours. all things are ours. it seems to me, we are inexcusable, if we stagger at Gods promises, for He is not a man that he should deceive us. nor does he ever say and not do it. In reading your relation of your cousins happy death, while I sympathized with you in the loss of a friend, I rejoiced in the Lord who had by his Grace made your Sorrow not without hope, but encouraged you to look for an eternal union in Glory. At the same time. I was deeply convicted of my own negligence in not spreading daily before the Lord, as you had done by your departed friend, the cases of my own unconverted friends and relatives of whom alas! too many are still living without God and without hope in the World. I can therefore say truly, that your letter did me much good, and though even since receiving it, I have not prayed for those around me as I should, and desire to do, yet I think I have prayed for them more than before-- Oh my dear friend let us become by Gods Grace men of Prayer! When I think that the Apostle tells us \"to\" pray without ceasing.\" and to \"pray in the Holy Ghost.\" and find how little I conform to these Precepts and yet reflect that god would not have given them, unless He designed that we should observe them, and unless by observing them we would become holier, happier and wiser in short more like God himsself, whose attributes are displayed [End Page 1] in his Holy Word; I am filled with shame and confusion [of?] face, at the neglect of this so great Salvation. When I examine myself by Gods Word, and remember that our blessed Jesus has told us, \"if you love me keep my commandments,\" my short-comings seem in my sight (what must they in Gods?) truly apalling; Yet I know in whom I have believed-- & I know that none ever looked to Jesus in vain. But [pray?] for me dear friend. for the pride of my heart is deep, & nothing but Gods Grace can subdue it. It is now almost a year since I was born again-- and though I have much reason to thank God for the Grace He has given to overcome many of his enemies and my own; yet looking into my heart is a humiliating task-- for Pride, Vain Glory, Selfishness and all Uncharitableness-- still keep their places [there?] in spite of my struggles to expel them. I know that I do not watch and pray as I should, and though I daily resolve to begin afresh, I find my progress in Grace is not as it should be. I am too prone to rise from the feet of Jesus, and instead of being a little child, am disposed to play the Man. Yet thanks be to God He does not suffer it-- but as soon as I begin to exalt myself He humbles me. And what to a Christian is more delightful, than at times when he is disposed to wonder in his own strength from the feet of his Lord and Master, to find himself drawn gently back, and being taught his weakness, to feel constrained to become again the helpless thing he was, when first he called upon Jesus to help him and received Salvation in answer to his cry. Oh my dear friend let us resolve to be forever at the feet of our blessed Lord-- for there & there only is Pardon and Peace and Love and Joy! Though we may wonder a thousand times and become soiled with the mire and clay of this World, yet a drop of the precious blood of Jesus will make us white as snow-- Let us live in Christ, not after the flesh (for what happiness have we got from the flesh) but after the Spirit. Let us pray always for the Spirit and then we will pray always in the Spirit-- and the Spirit maketh [intercession?] for the Saints for those things which are [End Page 2] according to the [illegible: page torn. Word?] [illegible: page torn. God?]. Oh what a priviledge to know that what we ask we shall receive-- because the self same Spirit which prays for us, and in us, is the Holy Spirit of the ever living God! Blessed be God forever! You were complaining of your difficulty from finding that though daily pardoned, your besetting sins still daily god the better of you, and you sometimes were almost ashamed to as pardon again,-- but, as you ended by saying God is indeed as constant to pardon as we to sin-- This experience of yours is. I apprehend common to all of Gods children, when first brought into His marvellous light; Grace is in us and is fighting against Nature, but we must work out our own Salvation with fear & trembling. In my contests with our Spiritual Enemies, I [illegible: hole in page. have?] [illegible: hole in page. found?] it of great use, under God. to keep a kind of Diary of Sins, (and a block catalogue mine is.) At night, & in the morning, & at other times of the day when peculiarly tempted, I write down the results of self examination, made by Gods Word. and under his eye; I then write down a few prayers against the sins thus [illegible: hole in page]-- & pray and wrestle against them, until I feel something like Peace and Joy. I thus have a kind of [illegible: torn page. History?] of my past Battles with my Adversaries, and by reading them over at times, I see how \"my enemies thrust at me some, but in the name of the Lord I overcome them\" & thus gather strength & courage for the time to come-- At times when sorely beset. I devote a day to fasting and humiliation and prayer-- and can truly say that I have never cast my burden upon the Lord, without finding him sustain it as he promised. You will excuse the [scrawl?] of this letter for you know it of old-- And I write in haste for the Mail. We are I hope here on the eve of a Glorious Revival; For months past we have been praying for one-- and from many indications, we cannot but hope that Gods set time has come-- There has been a considerable Religious Excitement among our coloured People-- You would be delighted to see the Power of Gods Grace in them-- They cling so simply to [Jesus?] and seem to love him so tenderly, that I often am inclined to [End Page 3] envy them. In riding out the other [illegible] with my brother (whose mind is deeply exercised upon the [illegible] of Religion, and for whose conversion let me beg your prayers), we were stopped by an accident on the [Road?], & upon my talking with a poor Negro about Jesus, the ignorant but happy creature talked so sweetly and simply of the Mercy of God, and his love of Christ, that my brother afterwards told me-- He would readily have exchanged places with him-- See the Power of true Religion-- A Member of Congress ready to change Salvations with a slave. Glory to God for the unspeakable gift! Our Pastor here & some of his pious laymen have been labouring a great deal among the blacks-- and our efforts have not been unblessed-- the Revival has begun amongst them & I do not doubt that it will pervade all classes, God grant it. Our State has undergone a great change as to Religion in the last year and I do not doubt that Gods dealing in this way is to have an effect upon our Political Relations-- Pray for us, especially for our leading men-- as well as those of the General Government-- & we may yet see our Leaders adorned with that Righteousness which adorneth a Nation-- Let us my friend-- pray not only for the Peace of Jerusalem-- but of our Country, & indeed of all Nations-- and do not forget the outcasts of Israel-- Let us pray daily for the Jews-- But my Paper is out-- My family is well & if it be his will I should rejoice were He to bless you in this way as He has done me-- Christian Love to all of your family & friends Yours in Christ Wm. H. Barnwell To Edgar B. Day Catskill New York Wm H. Barnwell Sep 3 1832[End Page 4]"
