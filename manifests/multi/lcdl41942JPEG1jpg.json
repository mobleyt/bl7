      "value": "A.M.D.G Ursuline Convent & Academy \"Valle Crucis,\" near Columbia S.C. Ascension Day 1866 [In upper right margin] 10 May 1866 My Dearest Brother, I am so much obliged to you for your nice long letter. I hardly think I deserved it, for I have some compunctions visiting about my last being a little \"cantankerous\"--I hope it did not appear so to you, but I do not feel altogether comfortable about one sentence in it. Anna continues to improve. T.G. & is full of the notion of visiting Columbia. I hope she was able to approach Holy Communion 6th inst on the occasion of the \"Golden Wedding.\" I'm so sorry you could not be [In left hand margin in longhand] We send our letters without a shadow of hope for their success, but in prayer. Revd Dr. M-- left less this week--was quite well. All send very grateful respects & beg your prayers & benediction--especially your own Sister Ellen. Sr Baptista[End Page 1] in Cheraw at that time & say mass for, & give Holy Communion to our dear venerated Parents. I know it would have given them great happiness. John sent them over a large handsome wedding cake made to order & we put up a Box of trifles & sent them for Express, I hope in time to reach them on Saturday evening. I Cut some \"altar breads\" & enclosed them in an envelope & tied it up with white ribbon after the fashion, in which worldly people send wedding cake, & sent it for their \"celestial Banquet.\" Could you have performed the marriage ceremony for them had you been at home? That[End Page 2] was a point of discussion at our Recreation. Just to think--fifty years of cares & joys--fifty years of mutually shared anxieties & responsibility-- & what a retrospect. As Sister Antonia (from whom I received a letter today) says-- \"May we serve God, were it but with a small share of their fidelity--! Francis wrote to her in time, so that she & her community as well as we & ours offered their communions for our dear Parents on Sunday. It is really very gratifying to see how very kind our Sisters were & cheerful in wishing to serve any one of our family, but particularly our dear Parents & you. Sister Antonia tells me that Revd Father Ruland C.S.S.r. has given her a Draft for $100-- For us[End Page 3] which he sends with pleasure only wishing it were the ten times more. Is not that Kind? I received a very laconic letter the other day, to which I sent a like reply. It contained $10. Mr. Trenholm has relieved the Lynch's of the house they wanted to sell-- & taken it back so it is not now for sale. We will enquire about the Starke place--John thinks it will not sell low. I am glad that Bp. Verot received kindly your proposition to give our Retreat, as it shows he is not offended at our apparent ingratitude. What a commotion this \"grand council\" is going to make. I suppose that Abp Splading will be created Cardinal by that time. The temporal power of our Holy Father is so [illegible], he ought to extend a protectorate for it, by creating cardinals in each country. Is Bp McGill to be transferred to Washington?[End Page 4]"
