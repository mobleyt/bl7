  "label": "Chintz Applique Quilt",
  "description": "The quilt is floral chintz with a fruit basket medallion. The basket is filled with various chintz fruits (grapes, pineapple, peaches, strawberries) and a bird. The center medallion is encircled with a floral wreath. The main body of the top is quilted in a scalloped (clamshell) pattern with cording. The central medallion is surrounded by four circular rows of hexagonal patchwork flowers. These hexagonal flowers were appliqued after the completion of the corded quilting. Appliqued fruit in rounded triangles are in each corner of the quilt within the borders. The quilt is framed by two floral patterned chintz borders. Main colors in the quilt are rose red, blue, and brown. No batting. Back is whole cloth linen or cotton. The hexagon flowers contain block prints, copper plate roller prints, Lafayette blue and tan prints, madder print, and others.",
