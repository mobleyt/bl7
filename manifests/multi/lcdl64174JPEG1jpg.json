July 18th 1780\nMy Dear Sir\nYour favr. of 9th Inst. got safe to hand\nlast evening. I had just rec.d an Account of your affair\nwith Mr. Kniphausan at Springfield, and intended this\npost to have Congratulated you on your success, - your Ob-\n-servation respecting the people of America [and] the rules\nthat's set over them, is perfectly just, - The whole Con-\n-tinent seems to have received a paralytick stroke\nand now totter with a palsy. the reflection is\nalarming to think of the resources we have amongst\nus and that ways and means cannot be devised by\nour knowing ones, to profusly [sic] draw them forth.\nAmerica is full of supplies of every kind and not-\n-withstanding she is now fighting for her all, none\ncan be found. If we fail in the present Contest, it\nwill not be for want of means; in fact we shall\ndie of the Doctor. Virginia seems to have received\na more Severe stroke than any of her sister States.\nshe had totally relaxed into a Lethargy. Cornwallis's\nadvance however, has rouged them in some measure\nand has made an Alteration in the Disorder; there is\nnow a ray of hope. – The mode for re-enlisting\nher Continental Quota, as hinted to you in my last\nis in part adopted, She is to rain Bavo men immed-\n-diately by Classing the militia into Squads of 15\nmen, obliging each Squad to find a man by a given\ntime as to cast both amongst themselves who shall go.\nThis plan would have raised five Thousand men, had\nthe whole of the militia been included, but some of\nthe Back Countries are excused on Account of a threaten\n-ed invasion by Sullivans opponent Mr. Butler, who\nit is said, is preparing for that purpose. and another\n[End Page 1]\nreason is, they are not to Class any under the age of\n18 years. of Age, This would have done pretty well\nhad they raised them for the war. but would you\nbelieve it! That notwithstanding the many recent, and\nI may add fatal Examples, of short Enlistments, they\nhave raised them to serve 18 months only! My prayers\nand Supplications was for the war. I painted the fatal\ntendency of such a measure in the most alarming\nColours I could draw it, but all [?] not do, and\nthis strange infatuation prevailed, from the shameful\nfrustration [as you observe] of public good to Po-\n-polar motives. – They have also adopted the re-\n-commendation of Congress respecting finance, much\nmanuevring [sic] was used for this purpose, - When\nit was first introduced they rejected it by a Vote of\n[7?] against 23. Means were found to bring it\non again in the coarse of the Session, and after\nmany days Debate, and a most Violent opposition\nin every stage of the Bill, it was at last carried\nby a majority of two. – If the assembly had not\nrescinded their first determination, we were all\nundone. persisting in their first Idea would not\nonly deprived us of resources, but the Example might\nhave been fatal to the whole Continent. This added\nto their [?] policy, and their want of Exertion\nin affording timely assistance to South Carolina would\nhave placed us in a very disagreable [sic] point of view\nwith respect too the other States. – North Carolina\nis still fast asleep, notwithstanding the Enemy Knock\nat their doors. Major Fosythe has this day returned\nfrom thence where he has been on the Business of\nhis Department, he informs that it was with the\nutmost Difficulty he could find supplies sufficient\nfor the Troops going forward. he brings an Accot.\n[End Page 2]\nof a body of Tories of near a Thousand strong\nbeing defeated by a Col.o [Colonel] Loche, who killed 70, and\nmade 200 prisoners, These rascals were Armed\nand embodied in the back parts of that Country [and]\nwere making their way to the British Stand\nand by two different routs, foraging and laying\nwast [sic] the Country as they went. –\nGen. l [General] Gates has gone forward. I note\nyour friendly hints, upon the Service of the \nSouthern Department, and was previously deter-\n-mined in my line of Conduct, well knowing the\nbad effects of party darings and trust I shall not\nbe backward in duty. – I have been honored with\na very polite letter from the president of Congress\ninclosing their Resolution for Calling me into\nService again. This was so fair an opening\nof for retorting that I could not help embracing it\nI told them in plain words of their treatment\ntoward me, I reminded them of a Subsequent\nResolve which they past [sic] after I left them, of\nforbiding [sic] any officer who should resign his\nCommand, coming into Service again, on any\nother Terms than as youngest, of the Rank \nIn which he belonged, and concluded by telling\nthem that the total Deranged situation of our\naffairs in the South, and the Glowing Countenanc[e]\nof things in General were Sufficient motives\n[as the Obstical [sic] which gave me uneasiness was\nin some measure removed] for my ready\nObedience to their Call, And that my Exertions\nshould not be wanting so long as I could Act\nConsistant [sic] with my feelings as an Officer, and\nso long as my honor was not violated by the\nhands of power. -      You are pleased to\n[End Page 3]\nflatter me Exceeding in one paragraph of your letter\nmodisty [sic] forbids my saying anything more on that\nhead than “Thank you[“].  Where in the name of\nwonder is the French fleet? I have been in hourely [sic]\nExpectation of hearing of their Arrival these three\nweeks, and begin now to think they have touched\nat the vast Indias for some particular Operations\nthere, before they come on our Coast. – I am\npleased to hear of your Ladies Health, perhaps\nwe may have a Cotilian [sic] together one of these\ndays. pray make my respect to her, [and] believe\nme very affectionately \nMy Dear Genl. [General]\nYr. Most Obt Servt. [Your Most Obedient Servant]\nG. [George] Weedon\nP.S. When you see the worthy little\nMarquis, tell him I congratulate him\nsincerely on his once more coming a\nmongst us.    -   GW [George Weedon]\n[Endorsed on right margin:]  From Genl. [General] Weedon\nJuly 18th. 1780.\n55\nVirginia \n146\n[End Page 4]"
