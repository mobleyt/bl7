      "value": "Cat Island Friday Night Decr [December] 27th 1861 My Dear Wife Your letter written on the 20th I recd last night, six days old! Yet I was glad to get it, old as it was I was glad too to hear from you all but the tooth ache that is not so well and for fear it is still aching I have cut out a soverign [sovereign] remedy for it out of the Courier and enclose it to you. try it. it cant do any harm. We have been engaged yesterday and to day. Not with the Yankees however, but engaged moving our tents, out a little distance from the Fort say about as far as from our House to Toms. The Engineers who are working on the Fort intend to cut down all the timber within one thousand yards of the Fort, this will be done in order to get good open range for the Guns on the Fort, and to prevent the enemy from covering themselves with the Woods to make an attact [attack] in the rear, it will however make the place very cold, indeed I find it so tonight, we have cut down all the trees inside of our Camp Ground and this wind comes sweeping down the Bay bitter cold. I don't know so well about Edgars comeing [coming] down here. Just at this time in the first place\n[End Page 1]\nthe weather is cold and he might get sick by coming out from a warm House out into the woods and sleeping on the ground in a cloth Tent with no chance of fire only out in the open air, then if it should come on to rain he would suffer with cold might take Pneumonia or Pleurisy, again there is no knowing at what time we may have an engagement with the Yankees, and I would have no chance to have him sent off to a safe place, as there is noboddy [no body] on this Island but Souldiers [Soldiers] and they would not get the chance to leave on any sort of errand. Upon the whole I must forego the pleasure of having him here for the present, tell him to wait till I come Home and if all is quiet here then I will bring him down with me when I come back. I intend to Build me a Log Hut and put a chimney to it as soon as I can then I will let Edy stay with me a long time. We had a regular alarm here last Tuesday night You know I wrote you that on Tuesday morning a Schooner was run ashore by a Lincoln Vessel and that the crew escaped in their Boat after setting fire to the Schr [Schooner] Well the Yankees sent fire boats up the inlet to the Burning Schr [Schooner] to put out the fire and tow her off. Well it so happened that Lieut Hailler of Company D who are stationed on North Island with six of his men were up the Beach Scouting and concealed\n[End Page 2]\nthemselves behind the Sand Hills from where they fired upon them and drove them off. they had fixed a Rope to the Schr [Schooner] and were about to succed [succeed] in getting her off, but when Hailler fired on them they were in such a hurry to leave that they cut the Rope, they fired back at him but done no damage, they made a second attempt to land and he drove them off a second time. Well about 8 o'clock that night the Col wrote to Norman saying that he had received intelligence from a Messenger that the enemy had occupied North Inlet. Ordered us to Double our Guard and be ready at a moments notice for any emergency, the man who brought the Letter said that there was one thousand or fifteen hundred of them. You may guess we had an exciting time. We placed 18 men on Guard with Loaded Guns and with strict orders to hail everything walking on land or floating on water and to shoot everything that would not stop when hailed. About Eleven o'clock at night I herd one of the sentinels on the waterside hail, no reply, he hailed again. No reply then he fired and called for the Corporal of the Guard, the Corporal went to him and directly I herd [heard] him break out in a hearty laugh it seems that a Stick of Tim ber with an empty Barrel on it went floating by and refused to halt or answer when the Sentinel ordered it to. It proved next morning to be a false alarm. No\n[End Page 3]\nattempt had been made by them to land further than to get the Schr [Schooner]. Yesterday a Large War Steamer came so close to the bar that the men on board\tcould be seen. She was loaded with Troops apparently the men on Board were practising with small arms the firing could be distinctly herd [heard] from shore. I have no doubt they intend to give us a round before long and my only fear is they may attempt it before we are ready, we must trust to luck and courage but more so in Providence. I still expect to come Home the first week in January if I don't you may know one of two things either that we are pitching into the Yankees or are about to do so. I will write again by the first opportunity One of our men, William Moore died today very suddenly, he has been in bad health for a month or more but nothing serious until day before yesterday when he left here for the Hospital on South Island, he died with Pleurisy, he was a good souldier [soldier] and will be missed by the Company Write to me as often as you can Good night it is time to out lights Yours John R Beaty\n[End Page 4]"
