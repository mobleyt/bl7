I woke up- wide awake as though it really happenedand\nI was wondering if it was just as you were going to bed at Pearl Harbor\nand had hugged me. It was 5.05 A.M. I wonder what the difference in\ntime is between us.\nI see where Forestal has been out there speaking to you all. To-night\nthe President made a speach.Did you listen? He said $25.000. was all\nthat any individual income would be allowed. I can see I shall have to\ncut some wjere some how. I hate stopping wages but I think maybe we\nwill have to do somthing about Miss Finucan.\nI wrote the Guaranty Trust last night to buy you 50 John Manswille and\n15 Guaranty Trust- common stocks form you cash account. Doomis Sayles\nadvised it. I hope you approve.\nMy Darling I can hardly wait for your first letter. Maybe you gave one\nto Jim Forestal to bring back? Are you living in a house? What is it\nall like? How are you?.etc. etc.\nCharlie Baskerville is all decked out as a Captain in the Air Co[r]ps. He\nis to do some big painting jobs and his thrilled. After being in\nuniform 48 hours he found himself winging his way with a big shot to\ninspect West Point. I think he made his General laugh and that is how\nhe came to go along. He adored it. Every one asked him about difference\nairplanes thinking he new all and ofcourse he did not know one from the\nother. He really ahd a laugh at himself.\n[End Page 1]\nHave you heard the new definition of celaphane commission? ..........\nYou can see through it but it keeps off the draught.\nI spent Sunday in Virginia at Marjorie and David Finley's. You know\nVandergracht built their house right on the Eustis estate .Its sweet.\nSuch a beautiful view of the mountains. We lunched. I played tennis\nsingles with Chip Bohlen[just returned from Japan] we swam in a pool\nand I [r]eveled in the green grass, lush field, fat cattle and horses\nand green corn. My it was peaceful and lovely. I do miss the country\nterribly. It seemed so queer being in the country with out Clippy. My\nI miss him so much. We went in my station wagon but it was worth the\ntwo coupons to get there.\nMy job gets me home later and later. 7.30 to-night. I am so glad becaue\ntime really goes fast and there is less time here in the living room\nthinking how I wish I was with you.\nDo you want some books or pills or anything. Let me know.\nCharlie Baskerville was so crippled with his back a few weeks ago that\nhe could not ven straigten up enough to life his hand and take the oat[h]\nHe went to the Specialst Dr Ober in Boston. He was examines.Ober said\nhe had one leg longer than the other, his pelvis was there for not on\nan even keel which was causing all the trouble. He put a lift in his\nheel [of his shoe] and now several weeks later he looks as thought he\nhas swallowed a ramrod. He is thrilled. I think you should get your bac[K]\nset and wear a lift in your shoe too. Do you remember you tried it and\ngave it up. I think you were om the right track and should try it again[.]\nI have a glimmer of a hope for a house which I am to investigate to-\nmorrow. I hope it materialises. It would be wonderful. Anyhow I am fix[e]d\nfor one more month. When I move out of here Oct 1st I can move to Helen['s]\nold house for the month of October as she is moving into her new oneon\n[End Page 2]\n2\nthat date and her lease does not expire till Nov. 1st so I shall rent\nit off her hands and have a roof a little longer.\nI have invited Mr. Newbold for dinner Wed night[at last] I have hired\nthe cook and am going to have Baskerville,Helen and Chi and Mrs Bohlem and\nmaybe Francis Stewart and Bill Ewing.\nmy book keeper is off on a trip to the roast beef country having just \nfinished with the feaver areas. Things seem to be going alright.\nLots of love to you my sweet heart. I must say goodnight and go to\nbed. How I would love to scratch your black curly head and kiss you ears.\nMy love to Morris.\nGertie\nP.S. Sammy Trencher called me up on the phone from Virginia They wre there over\nLabor Day. He said the theatres were going swell.and that Morris['] house had been\nrented again.\n[End Page 3]"
