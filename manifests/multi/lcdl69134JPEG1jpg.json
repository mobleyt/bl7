      "value": "40\nDecember 23,1942\nGertie Darling,\nPepper came yesterday and left thepackage\nwith me. I am holing my breath a[nd] patience waiting until\nChristmas morning to open all your gifts. There are so\nmany boxes from you that I do not know which one I will\npeek into first. Probably I will be like Bo last year when\nshe likes the ribbon so much on one of her presents that\nshe only wanted to play with that and did not bother to\ngo any further.\nPeople re wonderful in the way they still\ntry to have christmas out here. There a[r]e no trees, befo[re]\nthey were all shipped out from the mainland. Now they take\nboards , bore holes in them and then stick the bracnches ofX\nbushes into the hols and tnus make a tree. They are very\npeculiar looking[,]but you see them through the windows of\nthe houses all covered over with tinsels and bits of xxxxxxx\ncolored cloth when tinsel was not available. The only thing\nis there are not any little white children to enjoy christmas.\nOnly little japs and orientals. Usually at this time of year\nyou see children on the streets with eyes as big as saucers.\nI miss them quite a lot, they are such an intergral part of\nthe season.\nThe weather is very hot. The sky has cle red\nand the sun beats down out of a cloudless blue all day so\nthat I am glad to be inside and when I have togo form\nbuliding to building I am covered with perspiration. It seems\nsos_trange to read of the snow and ice in the states, and of\nyour freezing at twenty or fifteen degrees when I sleep without\npayjamas or a sheet. The sun is just rising when we leave\nour apartment in the [M]orning at seven and the doves\nare cooing and flying above the canal in long sweeping flights.\nThose lovely mountains that lie back from the coast are dark\nblue with their va_lleys filled to the brim with mist and soft\ncl ouds that seem to be rising up to meet the first shafts\nof light. The air has that wonderful softness and warm freshness\nthat we have always remembered in tropical lands and the\nwaters of the can[a]l m_rror the tall palms that fringe its\ncourse. Morris and I are always thrilled with the beggining\nof this ride, then as we a ro ch honolulu the traffice becomes\nheavy and after passing thru the city it is impossible. All\nthe world seems to be on the road to Pe rl Harbor and youstop\nand st[A]rt as you sl[o]wly corscew your way along. Several men\nhave said frnakly that they prefer Guadalcanl to Morris's\ndriving in in the morning. The risk is so much less they clai[M]\n[End Page 1]\nOnce we arrive and leave the trembling shaking car le ning\nagainst a tree life ag in becomes normal. We enter the\nBOQ for breakfast and wait in line to enter the dinning room.\nAt the door you pay thirty cents for a ticket and then enter\nan almost square room at the far end of which there is a\nlong monel metal counter. Here you pick up your tray, plates\nand cutlery and approach the first guardian of the food.\nA wonderful simple looking negro who c n not put the anc kes\non your plate without a terr[i]fic flourish of his laddle.\nNext is the chi[p]ped beef or cornbeef hash man, a little fellow\nwho is always gazing into the distance so that often it is\nbetter t o serve yourself rather than to awake him. two\nshu fling steps in the line beyond is the keeper of the eggs.\nEither scramble or fried , you have your choice. Also there\nis no limit on the number or amount. I have seen men with as\nmany as six friend eggs on their plate at one time. A few\nfeet further on is an enormous tray xxxxx golden with pats of\nbutter. I usually spe r about six pats or a quarter of a\npound, pick up papai , pinapple or prunes and a glass of\norange or grapefruit joice jus t beyond the butter and then\nstop in front of a wonderful enormous coffe[e] cauldron whose\nbellly holds inumerable cups , so m ny in fact th t no m n\nhas ever plumbed the depths of this delicious fluid.\nWe t en select a table at which men we know are sitting and\nproceed to guzzle all the goodies on thepl te. Ocassionalywe\nsend a mess man for more coffee of a few more waffles or pan\nc kes but as a general rule I only eat one helping of\nev rything because I think we should a_ll do without in\norder to aid the war effrot , don't you? Back we go to the\ncar and ride up to our building, graon up three flight of\nsteps and are helped into our chairs by solitious yeoman.\nOnce we re confortable settled we belch and make won[d]erful noises\nuntil about nine when the coffee mess man announces th t fresh\ncoffee has been brewed. We then have a cup apeice with lots\nof cream and sugar and proceed to look over the mornings mail\n. If there is anything interesting we read it to one nother\naloud while sma[ck]ing our lips over some crackers or other\nsm ll food that we are continualy nibbling at to keep up our\nstrength. I will describe the remainderof the day to yo[u]\nin an_other letter as I want you to have a cle[A]r picut[r]e of my\nlife, and times.\nSunday was a most heavenly day. Hot sun, blue\nsea with planes putting on a wonderful exhibition of dog\nfighting above our heads as they practiced God only knows what.\nSome of them are incredible fast and after they make a dive\nzoom up and out of sight before you can open both eyes in\nsuprise. Fat face morris did not come back from the o fice\nuntil lare in the afternoon so he never came on the beach and\nas a result is as white as sheet, with that wonderful green\nlook about the gills that only executi[V]es and fu[r]heres have.\nWe are taking our liker r tion to our christmas dinner so even\nif the food is terrible we will h ve a very good time. Did\nI tell you the night I went to dinner with a captain and was\ndetrmined to look so smart that I made a_ll the mistakes one\ncan. Forgot my shoulder boards, buttons etc. I believe I\n[End Page 2]\ntold you about it in a previous letter.\nSorry I have to quite . Lots of work. All\nmy love.\nSidney J. Legendre\n[End Page 3]"
