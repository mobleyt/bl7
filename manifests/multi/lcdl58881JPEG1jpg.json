      "value": "A   last OOK-Here is the buiding at 85 and 87 Broad street which  is to be atered by new owners to provide quarters for two stores  on the first foor.   The   Building   Is isted    as \"Vauable\"    in \"This is  Charleston JivBfe Heyward ived In the-bgje as a boy.  9Wamp;B 1 wnfamp;   t   OH. .  Zoning aw Cannot Stop  Changing of 85-87 Broad  W  9   \"4S  Extensive aterations, now being  made in the Igfe century brick  buiding at 85 aSRMB7 Broad street,  cannot be prevented\" under the  present zoning aw,\" it was earned  yesterday from Bernard M. Thomson, city engineer. The zoning restrictions do not affect the buiding which ies within the business  district, and the necessary permit  to remode has been granted.  Saying thaf-tiiere is \"nothing we  can do\", Vic\"s Thomson decared  that the makers of the zoning aw  must have overooked that section  of Broad street. The city Hall itself ies in the business district, he  {Minted out.  The ower story is being remodeed into two stores.  The buiding beongs to eon and  Nichoas Drake, who bought it last  fall for $23,500. The former said  yesterday that they expected to  spend $7,200 in remodeing. The  plans for the changes have been  drawn by Stephen Thomas, architect. Each stBre will have two llarge  pate gass windows, with the entrance in the midde. Running  above the windows and doors will  be a smooth white stucco plane and  moud.  The new store fronts should re-  | sembe the sort of work now being  I done in New York, Mr. Drake said.  He denied that the buiding will  house a iquor store and said that  it .was intended to rent out the  stores, and that they might be occupied by fower and drug estabishments. He said that 323 empty  bottes and 66 boxes of trash already have been removed from the  premises.  Under present plans, the archway at the entrance to the passage  which runs through the center of   he buiding\" will be unchanged.  Access to the upper foors will be  tibtained through side doors open-  ,ng from the passagev ay- These   ere the origina entrances, Mr.  ]rake said.  I The first sign that the old and  mark was being remodeed came  last week, when two wooden portas, one of Doric and the other  of Ionic design, were removed from  the front 6f the buiamp;t;yn. Mr.  Thomas, the architect, said yesterday that he had hoped to be able  to place them at the new doors  which will be made for the stores,  but that they had proved to be decayed, and the idea had been given  up.  The changes to the old Building  aroused considerable discussion at  the meeting of the Society for the  Preservation of old Dweings, yesterday afternoon in the Heyward-  Washington house, 87 Church street.  isted as \"vauable\" in \"This Is  Charleston\", the buiding is an exceent example of the staunch and  workmanike construction of eary  Charleston houses. It is made of  bricks, with the front aid in Femish bond, and contains fooring and  other timber of a quality impossibe to obtain now.  DuBose Heyward, author of  \"Popgy\", passed part of his boyhood  in the house, where his widowed  mother had an apartment."
