Dear Mr. Krawcheck:  I want you to know that i appreciate your calling on me  today, for the purpose of discussing informay, the  problem of parking in cose proximity to the retai  district, that will become more accute when the gaso_  Line restrictions are. ifted.  It is my thought that the first step should be that  the merchants located on King Street, between Broad  and Line Street, to fuy agree on thete being no  of  parking of cars in the  fre i ght de i i veri es.  said area, other than the  It is my thought, that once this plan is concurred  unanimousy by thoee interested, that City Council will  fee justified in passing an ordnance to the said  effect.  The natura outcome of this course, would set a great  many enterprising individuals or firms, to thinking in  terms of acquiring ide property situated between the  bocks adjacent to King Street area and develop same  into parking ots.  while it would be an idea plan for the city itself  active  in  to undertake the acquisition of certain properties  strategicay located and converting same into attrati  parking ots, with the introduction of parking meters,  order to make the investment sef iquidating, I am  afraid that insuperable compications will arise, that  will dteptFt the purpose in mind.  At least it may be within the ream of possibiity, that  the city may be induced to at least try the plan in a  givenLocalityrj to be expended ater on, if the financia  outcome is encouraging.  However, from a practicalble point of view, | am of the  opinion, that once the restriction on parking from Line to  A COMMUNICATIONS TO  BE   ADDRESSED   DIRECT TO  THE   COMplanY\n\n[End Page 1]\n -2_  Broad is put into force, that there will be a surge of  private interest, who will be eager to capitaize on  the opportunity offered.  wishing your committee every success in this spendid  civic effort, I rema j n,  Your  A Ibert SettiIe.
