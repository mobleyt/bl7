      "value": "Progressive Club Sea Island Center\nRiver Road\nJohn's Island, South Carolina\nMrs. Gadney Howe\nChairwoman, AntiPoverty Program \n554 Huger Street \nCharleston, South Carolina\nDear Chairwoman and Committee:\nJanuary 12, 1965\nAs President of the above organization since 1948, and also President of the Citizens Committee of Charleston County since 1959. \nI am submitting this proposal. These organizations are chartered by the State Department of South Carolina, and the charters of each \nsigned by the Secretary of the State of South Carolina, Mr. O. Frank Thornton. The charters read: that the said organizations \nhold or desire to hold property in common for religious, educational, social, fraternal, charitable, or other elemosynary purpose. The \nsaid corporation are non-profit. Charters are number 1145 and 1859.\nI am a native of Johns Island, Charleston County and South Carolina. I have been having monthly meetings with people over the years, \ntrying to obliterate ignorance, to promote health and social, educational and civic welfare, and to combat juvenile delinquency \n--to secure a more rich and abundant life for ourselves and for our posterity.\nThe people with whom I work are some of the poorest ones on God's earth, I believe. If I were to tell you all the conditions of some\nof the homes that I have visited, I don't think you would bekieve that these conditions still exist in America at this day and time.\nBecause of these unbelievably poverty-stricken people of whom so few people in rich America know anything. I request that as many of you\nas possible, if you please, come to Johns Island and let me take you all over the Sea Islands and over Charleston County, that you \nmay get a view of what I am talking about. Please notify Spring Street in Charelston, or 766-9147 at the Progressive Club Center, \nRiver Road, Johns Island. Because of the conditions borrowed and begged for money to help build a center that our boys where they can \nplay basketball, table tennis, and other games, or skate. We have also had workshops on Citizenship. We have had a few folk song\nfestivals, which were all well-attended by both races. We can't have these too often because of the lack of money.\nNow our people are asking us to assist themin many areas in which we cannot give help unless we can get a grant from the other \nantipoverty Program. The following are the thinds these poor\n\npage two:\npeople are requesting:\n1. Day care for pre-school age childrenfrom seven A.M. to six P.M.\n2. Classes in sewing, knitting and ceramics and other crafts for the 16 to 21 age group in the evening from seven to nine.\n3. Evening classes in basketball, weightlifting, adult remedial reading, music, and workshops pm ,pra; amd citizenship resposibility, including \ntaking part in registration and voting and learinin to use the voting machine.\n4. The creation of some jobs for children who have left school, and after-school jobs for schoolchildren.\nThese requests have come from approximately thirty parents who make from $600.00 to $2,000.00 a yearand have from two to eight children \nin their homes. About fifty of these children are too young to go to school, causing the school-age children to stay out of school two\nor three days a week to take care of the younger ones when the mothers and fathers are out working to support the children and the homes.\nThis condition causes many of our children to drop out of schools. Abscence from classes and poverty are the reasons. The children \nbecome too old and too large for the low grades, and younger children trase them about this and thy become asheamed and quit school.\nIf we will be considered for the grant asked for, we can employ tweleve or fourteen persons for the Progressive Club Center's programs, \nand one full-time secretary and two part-time workers at the Citizens Committee office, 41 Coming Cannon Street.\nThis may not contain all of the information you would like to have, but this is a basic description of what the poepl in our community \nare asking for at this time. I would like to ask for someone from your office to assist us in writing a final proposal if this \ndoes not meet the approval of the Governor and the Committee.\nA grant of $107,640.00 for a two-year program, or $53,820.00 for one year, will help us set up a working staff of people whom we feek are \ncapable of running this project well. We are enclosing a proposal on expenditures of these funds, and realize that we will have to recieve \nexpert advice in making up a final proposal.\nMadam Chariwoman and Gentlemen, if you would give us this badly needed grant, whihc would help alleviate povery in this area, \nwe are willing to do our part in seeing this become a reality.\nOur kitchen, plumbing and sleeping quarters at the Progressive Club Center have been inspected by the Board of Health  and approved.\nAt present we have enough bes to put 38 children in for their mid-day rest, and also a place large enough to feed them. These facts\nare known by the Board of Health and approved. At present we have enough beds to put 38 children in for their mid-day rest, and also a \nplace large enough to feed them, These facts are known by the many hundreds of people who have benefited from our services in one way or \nanother. The above cost is what it will take for elven months' operation per yearly for two years. One month's vacation us taken each\nyear.\n\npage four:\nCc: Governor of South Carolina, Columbia, S.C.\nThe following persons have signed the above proposal because of the crying need in thier organizations:\n(signed) Esau Jenkins President, Progressive Club Citizens Committee\n(signed) J.H.
