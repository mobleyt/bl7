      "value": "JMJ Ursaline Convent Columbia September 18th 1858 My dearest Brother It is past bed time for us Saturday night, but I cannot go to sleep without saying a few words to you, which I would not have leisure to write tomorrow - we all well DV and doing well. Mother left today at 1 o'clock for Cheraw and Bernard with her. We were very sorry that you could not come but there is a good time coming and after all it is such a blessing to me to be near enough to you as to get a letter in as short a time that I would reproach myself with ingratitude if I (?) in the least. Mother is quite well, as were all at our dear home yesterday - John's family too, as well as usual - Bernard has been poorly, but is better and will recruit at home for a fortnight or as [End Page 1] Mother did not believe the reports about Julia - James has a daughter Eliza was told today about Louisa and cried about as much as if she were not better How are the Srs? It was reported her that Sr Harris? was dead and several others sick and that several of the orphans from this place had died of yellow fever is it true or not? I sincerely trust the fever will soon abate, and the good Priests with you at their head, and the good Srs will preserve your strength in the midst of your labors, by every means possible by wholesome and frequent nourishment. My dearest Brother if you are not too busy please ask about our boxes, we want our blankets these chilly nights, and would be pleased to have other things in them too [End Page 2] Monday Morning 20th I had not time my dearest brother to finish or send my letter as I wished - Sr Ursula says you will be very much pleased with us we are so busy & you said you would pleased when we were so. Sr Augustin begs you will spare of blushes, calling us apostolic ?. I wish L ? could come to us - Mother says Louisa Blain is a treasure, so the sooner we get the treasure the better - We have our two ? instructions every Sunday, an ? class of girls in the morning from 8 to 8 3/4 - & in the evening the ? from 4 to 5. What is Mary Brownfield thinking of? I suppose the yellow fever engrosses every ones thoughts at present. I would be glad she thought of becoming a nun, as she never intends getting married. Is it true that Mrs Antonia ? is dead/ Sr Augustin wishes to write to ? but I told her not to venture until we were certain. John got a letter from Anna yesterday, written before Mother and Bernard had left here [End Page 3] Father and all were quite well DV. James has a daughter and Julia a son. I am very much pleased with my little nieces especially Ellen Spann. they will come to school today and Ellen will not return to Johns, but remain a boarder. Mr Bollers? oldest daughter will enter today also, and his second as a day boarder - $165 per session. The bell is ringing ? by the children coming to school, so I must stop this. I have plenty to say as usual. I think is was providential that you did not come up to Columbia when Mother was here, as by sleeping a night out of Charleston, I am told you would expose yourself to fever. We are happy to hear that Louisa is better, and hope all the good Srs and clergy are quit well. If our poor prayers will do them any good they have them. Please pray for your most affectionate Sister Ellen. M B Sup[End Page 4]"
