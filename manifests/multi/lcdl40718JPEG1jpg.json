      "value": "Anderson, Sept 26th, 1868 A.W. Marshall Jr. Dear Sir, Your [yours] of the 9th inst. is at hand and in reply Rev. T.P. Keith deposited with me when he left this place for Charleston two Notes made payable to him on Smith Bailey ea for $300 to be paid in gold or its equivalent in Currency [Intest?] on ea from date I have also some of the original titles they are only for the use of RS Bailey the purchases whene Mr. Keith left the notes I was instructed to pay out of the [fist?] funds collected a Note or Mr. Keith held by [Wm?] M Archer and another held by R. Buress ea of those notes is for about $50 with Interest I have delayed writing until I would see those parties holding the note and a certain the amount Bailey has paid the Archer note and holds it for a Settlent Burgess still holds his I have collected on the note $10[End Page 1] and paid as instructed By Mr Keith to the collector of internal revenue offices to the payment of Dr. Kiths licence to practice medicine and I paid also a tax of $2.00 that was a tax on the Dr watch for two years Mr Bailey hold air account against Mr Keith that amount has never been presented I think it is a Small a portion of the a/e is for hauling the family Furniture to the Depot and Some other claims which I learned from Mr Keith was Small, I hold nothing that gave me any knowledge of the executor of land papers I think my advise was to execute titles and take a mortgage for the securing the payment of the Notes I hold you can advise me what to do with the Notes Mr Burrise Should be paid and this is the only debt against the Estate in this Dist. with the $2.00 Still due me on the Taxes I have not Seen Mr. Bailey Since the Death of Mr. Keith I fear he is Still unable to pay tho the debt is good as I feel certain Mr Keith did take my advises in holding a leave on the land untill paid for you need not be Surpirse if Bailey takes the advantage and pay with legal Tender Notes Your Truly Dal Brown [End Page 2]"
