  "description": "3 1/4\" X 5 3/4\" image showing front view of a two-story, raised house. The openings under the house are large enough to use as a garage and vintage automobiles are parked there. Front steps lead up to a porch that runs the length of the house and partway down the left side. On the right hand side are two wooden dependencies (sheds).  Moss covered oaks are in the foreground.  Believed to be Blessing plantation house.",
