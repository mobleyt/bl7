      "value": "Philadelphia Sepr. 23d My dear friend-- We had just returned from Niagara Falls, and Saratoga Springs, where we have been passing the Summer, when your very kind Letter, was sent me-- I am positively ashamed of myself towards you-- If my performances were as good as my good intentions I should be a faithful correspondent, but you have but too much reason to know my deficiencies-- Be it, as it may, my dear friend if my pen is [lazy?] & cold & inactive, my heart is not, [for?] it is always prompt & cordial to those whose welfare interests me as much as Mr B & yourself I was truly sorry to hear of the death of Mrs Cuthbert-- Death, is indeed a valley, how calmly she must have advanced towards it-- how consolatory to her afflicted Mother-- God alone, knows what is best for us in this present life-- I think much of her Mother-- what a treasury of promises is laid [open?] for her-- her Bible abounds with rich, & suitable & precious Blessings-- and she can with truth say Goodness & Mercy are assuredly mingled with all the dealings of her God-- As sinners we have no claims on Him for the smallest token[End Page 1] of his favour-- we are weak creatures & can do nothing-- do present my most affectionate Love to Mrs Keith, & assure her of my sincere sympathy under her heavy bereavement-- I will endeavour to send you this by Rev. Mr Rogers, who leaves this afternoon for Baltimore, on his return to Charleston-- (God willing)-- we shall leave here, the end of October, & travel slowly, resting as we generally do in Washington & Richmond-- so as to arrive in Charleston [the?] first week in November-- Before we left in the Spring-- we finished two rooms as parlour & chamber at Dr. Waring’s, believing we could have a home feeling there, as it will be quiet & no children-- no other Boarders but ourselves-- it will only be an experiment as we did not know what better to do,-- I do not like the idea of house keeping again-- having two rooms not occupied-- & Mrs. W. a nice manager-- we thought the advantage would be mutual-- [for?] we [could?] go & come as we pleased & not feel ourselves in the way of other Boarders, & leave some of our Luggage & Books, in our rooms, which we [were?] compell’d to take back every season with us-- I [sincerely?] hope this arrangement will prove comfortable [illegible] housing, so small a family-- The Doctor is so domestic a character, [illegible] he prepares a quiet regular, home feeling, [where?] we can enjoy our[End Page 2] friends, & not a constant change of faces, as we [are?] obliged to submit to, during the Summer, when we travel from place to place-- please to remember me [most?] kindly to your Aunt Mathews, with Your dear little circle around you not forgetting Miss Jordan-- Revd Mr Neufville? & Louisa [Bulloch?] [had?] just arrived from Newport, where they have been [passing?] the Summer, so [illegible] I must conclude this, to go down to them-- I am really glad to hear you are in such good health & grown so [fat?]-- I shall find all the children [Grown?] & informed, but most of all the little Baby, I left you with, from your account of him My kind [illegible: hole in page. Dr?] unites with me in affectionate regards to Mr B & [illegible: hole in page] and be assured that I remain unalterably yours very truly-- S.M.D Be sure to destroy this remember me kindly to Mrs Bee & her daughter Alice[End Page 3] Mrs William H. Barnwell Charleston S. Carolina[End Page 4]"
