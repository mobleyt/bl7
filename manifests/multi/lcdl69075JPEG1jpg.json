      "value": "Copy to American\nEmbassy\n31\nAugust 6, 1943\nDear Gertie,\nIn allt he world that is the fastest letter you wrote\nme that I have ever received. You mailed it at 5PM August the\n3rd and I received it at two oclock August 6th. That means it\nreally only took the third fourth and fifth to get here, the\nrest of the time it stayed in p[o]st offices. Just three days\nto go six thousand miles, incredible. I received a letter from\nyou yesterday dated July 31, written from Severn, Horse Hollow\nRoad, Polly's house. I read Morris passages from them both and\nwe roared with laughter at the descriptions fo the old women with\ntheir bare arms jangling with bracelets and the prop[o]sed sale of\nBoone Hall. If you can c tch a sucker for Medway and the two\nthousand five hundred acres for one hundred and fifty thousand I\nwould do it. Keep Spring grove and pine grove for o r own shootin\nand hunting, besides a little land to grow carrots in.\nYou could put up a tiny house at spring grove for ten thousand\nafter the war, would be on a paved road, and not have the expense\nof keeping up an enormous place as yo would only go there for the\nshoot ng as your real house would be in a much better place.\nI cannot tell you where to live out here as I am unable\nto leave the island on leave, there is no leave. I was sent away\non the ship for four days but that was business. Morris is leaving\nMonday on a cruise. As a result I ill not be able to get that\nother bathing suit that you want for some time . Two reasons are\nbehind this. One there are not any in town. You will remember \nthat youasked me for one in November. I use to ring the stores\nup abo t once a week and ask if they had any. Always the answer\nwas no. Tina ly one d y The East I[N]dia Shop or something\nlike that saidthey had a few and I rushed into town and pushed\nmy way through a mass of milling women to snatch those two out\nfor you. As soon as some more come to town I will descend and\ncapture a few. The other reason why it is so difficult to get\nany is that I cannot pull out of the office when I want to.\nI would have to get the captains permission to leave, and though\nI can do this the day the suits are there[,]I cannot do it everyday\nand go shopping to try and find them. However I will certainly\nkeep my eyes and ears open and will send you a couple as soon\nas I can.\nC[a]n you imagine that old Grodon Dougl_as ma ried\nagain. I thought I was so old that you would throw me out of the\nhose as useless but when I hear that such an old dodderer as that\nmarries gain I know for certain that marriage must be based on\ncompan onship, there could be nothing else there. You say that\nyou hope that I could walk into the room and the same [S]idney\nyou once knew. That is impossible. I am now a hard , furrowed\nface man. A creat re of strnage and horrible moods. Sardonic\nnd untrustworthy, but I must admit that a long eared fat\nspaniel still breaks me down.\n[End Page 1]\nThe conrete house that I wrote you about was the same\nhouse that I first described to you as dripping with\nbouganville, high up on the hi[L]l overl[o]oking the sea with\nthe be ches on either side curxxving towxards the Royal\nand cocox head. You can see what a difference a little discript\nion makes. Many times I have wonered what you wi l l think of\nthe island after you have seen it with only the descriptions\nof my letters to go on from the day we were hexre together.\nI will admit that t times I have drawn a rather long bow to\nmake it at[T]ractive, but all in all it is the most attractive pla\nce that I have been in in the last eleven months. Maybe\nyou wont be able to buy a place after the war[,]but maybe you\nwill , Who can [s]ee intothe future. We will have time to find x\nplaced when I have seen nothing else for a year, seen only\nNavy life and Navy peoplex. Maybe the people on the island are\nterrible. Perhaps it is a wild drinking likfe or a sour\nold maids paradise. I have seen nothing but the outrigger club\nand the Royal Hawaiian movies.\nWe had great fun this even ng. A boy from New Orleans\nwho we had not seen for years rang up and came over the otherx\nnight. We asked him to p;ay tennis and have dinner with us,\nWe met him on the tennis court of the Royal t[h]is afternoon\nand had great fun playing. When I last saw him he was\nsixteen with a round sweet face and the most perfect manners you\nhave ever seen. He is now a commander in the Navy, captain of\na submarine and has done the most wonderful job, and has\nbeen decorated ever so many times. His face is le[a]n and hard\nbut he is just as nice as ever. Just returned from a cruise on\nwhich his ship had done wonders and is now resting with his\ncrew before taking off again. I thought of the time when yo and\nI were here and we had a room and danced in the ballroom do wnst\nairs. However I could not remember t e otel very weill or wher\nour room was. His room us e to cost one hundred do_llars\na day, it has an enormous balcony looking over the sea and the\ndance floor. It cost him one dollar a day with his meals\nincl ded. From there we went to the Outrigger for\ndinner with three other submarine o[f]ficers and all talked.\nThey were fascinating, what lives they live. Always being\nb[e]pth bombed[,]never knowing when they will see the sun again.\nr[e]ally men of iron. After dinner we went back to the outrigger\nand saw the movies and then ho[m] to write to you. One f the\nbo s from the office is staying with us tonight and I have left\nhim outside in the living room where he will sleep on a sofa.\nMorris of course is in his ro m rea ing with his fat\nstomach going up and down very slowly as he smokes a big black\ncigar. He loves cigars b t like your father lets them go out\nall the time. Everytime he relights it I think a gas house or\na garbage heap has been moved into the ap[a]rtmkent.\nThat elephone bill certainly sounded like the\n[End Page 2]\nNational debt, but it was worth it and great fun to talk again.\nThat reminds me you mentioned in our conversation about houses\nand the people that are buying them. There is quite a furor\nour here because all the Japs are buying the hose for casex, and\nthe the saying on the islandis that the Japs will have won Hawaii\nno matter who wins the war. I think it is right because apparently\nwhen the Japs and orientals move into a neighborhood the nice\npeople move out just l[i]ke when the jews move in . That is why\nit is so difficult now to know where to buy as a[L]l the old neigh-\nborhoods are being ivaded and conquered.\nHow is it that you were at the island and at the river club\nand did not beat the tennis ball back and forth. You don't mean \nto say that you have slipped and become a weakling, a women that\ndoes not want to tire all the men out. I cannot believe it.\nSurely you kust have been playing something some where.\nI may not be ble to write you next week as often as I\nwill have to take over Morrises work, and he really has some work,\nand that is no fooling. I bet I will be plowed under. The\ncpatain calls on him about every five minutes besides all the\nother officers. He shou[l]d be a captain because he does the\nbest j[o]b you have seen. The Navy's idea of promotion is nuts.\nEveryone goes up together bad or good. Here th ey have a man\nthat should be a the head of an entire bureau. Brains tack,\neverything ti takes and they have him a lieutenant, his position\na sort of mail clerk, when acutally he does everything.\nSo ong nuts I have not the faintest idea where you will\nreceive this but it carries my love to the place tha t you do .\nSidney J Legendre\n[End Page 3]"
