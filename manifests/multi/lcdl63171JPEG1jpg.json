      "value": "[Page One]\nWashington\n15th May 1846\nMy dear sir,\nI am desirous of returning \nto private life in order to have the\ncommand of my time for the [illegible] of \nmy days, I would, therefore, be glad to be relieved \nfrom my duty, as Senator, after \nthis [Zepian?], showed my service be thought \nto be not essential. Other wise, I must \nmake the sacrifice, however great. All \nI can say at present is, that I shall do \nnothing hasty, and will certainly not come \nto any decision, until the [illegible] the approach \nof the next session.\nI fear you are too sanguine in supposing, \nthat we are near the period, when we \nmight justly anticipate the accomplish \nthe great objects for which we have so \nlong contended. A short time since the \nprospect was good; but now the curtain\nis dropt and the future closed to our view. \nA war with Mexico has been perpetually \n[Page Two]\nforced on Congress, contrary to its deliberate \nopinions, the end of which it is hard to see. \nShould it not be, by some good fortune, \nspending terminated, it is difficult to anticipate \nto what it will lead. I fear, in that case, \nit may not only arrest, or even defeat the \nadjustment of the Oregon question, but \nmay lead to the interference of the great \nEuorpean powers. \nBut be the consequences hereafter what it\nmay, already great mischief has been \ndone. The President is pregnant with \nevil. It sets the example, which will enable \nall future Presidents to bring about a state \nof things, in which Congress shall be forced, \nwithout deliberation, or a reflection, [scratched through]\nto declare war, however, opposed to \nits [corrections?] of justice or [illegible]. In \na word, it diverts Congress [virtually?] of the\nwar making power, and transfers it to the \nPresident, and even to the commanders on\nthe frontier.\nThere can at no future time be a stranger\ncase than the present. If it had been deliberately\n[Page Three]\nput to vote, whether it was right to order Genl [General] Taylor\nto the deliberate, or for time to take post [opposite?]\nto [illegible], and plumb his common anguish\nor that Mr. [Hidell?] should be sent to Mexico, when\nhe was and under the circumstances he was,\nor whether we should declare war on \naccount of the claims against Mexico, most of \nwhich are without foundation, there would\nhave been not a tenth part of Congress\nin the affirmative, and yet we have been forced\ninto a war.   \nI saw the danger early, and could have [moved?]\nan [arguing?], a resolution in reference to the \nmarch of our troops to the [due North?], more \nthan six weeks ago, had my position on \nthe Oregon question have permitted it, in \nmy opinion. That question was in the hand of \nthe Executive, and I regarded[?] it as my duty to keep \non good terms with it, in order to bring [scratched through] [the question] to\na peaceable termination. I said so at the time \nto several of my friends; and even went so far, as \nto speak to some of the Whig leaders triune \non the subject, as the reason[?] against my doing \nso did not apply to the war[?]; but nothing was done. \n[Page Four]\nAs soon as it was known that [hostilities?] had commenced and\nthat a Message would be sent, I saw at once, \nthat there must be war, unless a distribution should \nbe taken [between?] invasion, a war hostility,\nand war, and that the force to be raised \nshould be limited to the repelling of invasion, \nin the first instance, so as to give time con-\nsider, as to the [illegible] and [illegible] of de-\nclaring war. This was Saturday evning; and I devoted \nthe whole of Sunday in preparing my funds \nto take their stand on the distinction. Contrary \nto expectation, the Messenger, instead of being limited\nto the danger, to which General Taylor was captured[?]\nand the necessity of receiving lines and repelling the\nhostile attack, [illegible] if [illegible], as a \ncase of war. Our friends in the House \nwere not prepared for this state of \nthings. They fell into disorder and piddled to \nthe excitement of the movement. \nIn the Senate things took the right turn. A \ndecision was made, and the portion of the Message \nrelating to the raising of a force was sent \nto the Military Committee, and that which \nsulution to war to the [illegible] elections; \n[Page Five]\nand thus the object, at which I aimed, was \naccomplished. I felt [as if] we had got the con-\ntrol, and that all was safe. But events were \nordered otherwise. Col [Burton?], the chairman \nof the military committee, and who had made \nthe motions for the separation, gave away \n[and] reported the [bile?] of the House to raise \nvolunteers and to declare war [united?] in one; \nand which is worse our friends [of the Senate] with the [illegible]\nobjects McDuffie, had attended a caucus and \ngive[?] their assent. I saw at once, that all \nwas lost; and without hesitation took my stand \nwhere I believe duty, self respect and con-\nsisting equal.\nSuch is the brief history of this sad affair. \nNow that we are in war, it only remains, that \nwe shall do our duty; but at the same time, \nwe are bound to hold those responsible, \nwho have forced the country into its present \n[disreputable?] and dangerous condition. Had \nour friends [illegible] the slave, and time been \nadjusted to [illegible] the question of war \ndeliberately, I feel [illegible] that the vote\n[Page Six]\nwould have been two to one against it. \nI say this, I neither intend censure nor \ncomplaint, but simply to push you in full \n[illegible] of all the points, counted\nwith a transaction, which will be [illegible] \nin our history.\nAs to the Presidential question, I concur in \nall your say, as things stood when you \nwrote; but as they now stand, it ought to be \nwholly dropt. It will be [governed?] on \nby events, which remain to be developed. \nNo man can say which is to come, or in \nwhat condition the country will be placed \nthese months hence. \nI shall at all turns be happy to hear \nfrom you, and have your opinion and sug-\ngestions on all [efforts?].\nYours truly and [illegible]\nJ.[John] C.[Caldwell] Calhoun\nH.[Henry] W.[Workman] Conner Sr."
