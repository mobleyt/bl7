      "value": "Charleston April 13th 1848. My dear wife. I have been expecting to hear again from you; since the letter you wrote in pencil the day of your arrival at Laurel Bay. My sister however writes me that you expected me up, & this I suppose is the reason of your not writing. though I think it probable, I shall get a letter this afternoon. I have not heard from Rob since you left. I wrote to him the last week, & have written again today. I miss you all very much; but have been in good spirits; & hope to be with you on the 24th. You will send in for me that day. I took tea at your Aunt Mathews, last night. They were well. Mr Platt was ordained at [End Page 1] St Peters on Tuesday. I presented him to the Bishop. The Congregation was small. Confirmation is to be administered there on Tuesday next. The number of Candidates will not be large. I shall be a good deal engaged during the rest of the week in seeing them. I have been thinking of sending up some fruit for yourself & the children & probably shall do so on Tuesday next. You can send in to Beaufort for it. Kiss the children for me. I hope Edward takes care of the family well, & that Catharine & Bet & Hetty & Nan & Bill & Ste & Joe, are not only well, but do well. God be with you all. Remember me affectionately to them at Woodward. & believe me dear Catharine Your affect husband W.H. Barnwell [End Page 2] Mrs. Wm H. Barnwell Beaufort So. Ca. [End Page 3]"
