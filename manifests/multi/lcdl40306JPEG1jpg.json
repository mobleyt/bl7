      "value": "got any things of their make & we meant to take them to America. We only bought things however which we [serve?] for Christmas presents here among acquaintances and some few articles I can carry home as a \"[specimen?]\". We are invited to spend the day, \"Christmas\" or a part of the day at 5 or 6 places besides the pressing invitations of Mrs [Vroom?] to Berlin & my friend in Munich. We will probably pass it here. I am glad to say that I have received all the letters except perhaps one which you mention Aunt Betsy as having [directed?]. The last 4 have reached us in 16 days after date so that in 2 weeks I can now hear of you regularly -- do let it be a motive to more writing, I sent not long ago an appendix to my journal in form of a miserably scrawled letter -- has it arrived? I hope my journal is not becoming public property. [In crosshatch]: of his commencement of hog killing -- a sort of \"butcher Hog, sausage feast.\" You are probably celebrating a similar one. Do remember me to all my relations, Uncle R.s family particularly & uncle [illegible] & Aunt [illegible] also at Gdfathers, Aunt B's family, and to \"Bills wife & son\" [illegible] Lee & \"[illegible] George\" or \"Billy\"? also to Aunt Mathews when you write. I could cross thru sheet if I had any thing interesting to impart but having nothing I must close. [illegible] your affec son R W Barnwell (keep the envelope as a curiosity)[End Page 1] I meant it for \"home\" and perhaps a few [illegible] like Aunt Betsy, Aunt Martha out of \"home.\" It was written too carelessly for Public & bound only to please the girls & to make it available I have no doubt they have not read it all and the truth is it is very long in parts. I am very proud of my sisters & indeed of the whole family and find myself comparing them favorably with every one I meet and therefore dont feel very much distressed about Willie. He [illegible] talent -- it [illegible] a bad age now -- too old to be managed & too [illegible] to be persuaded & too boyish to have pride. When he gets older his Barnwell pride will wake him up to [exertion?], if as I trust will be the case better [illegible] & impulses do not. As for Ted, he is making so fine a man & winning so much esteem that when one remembers the future that many foretold as awaiting him, it seems like a great slander of him. I am satisfied[End Page 2] he will be a honor to us all -- so sterling, bold, highminded! Don't let Willie trouble you -- not that I rely on [illegible], especially when it is boastful but I trust upon the promises of God to his faithful ones & to his blessing upon a Christian education in the principles & paths of virtue & honor. But what is outward appearance? when the heart is so desperately wicked? We that have had hold of a righteousness not our own can humbly boast that our transgressions are taken away, but the others! Oh I wish the girls would think more of the things that belong to their peace! I was truly rejoiced to hear that the [waters?] were troubled & that [illegible] Grandfather Grdchildren had given herself up to the God of our fathers hoped Catty & Bet would soon be among the number. I would have written Bet Elliott a letter but did not know if it would be seasonable[End Page 3] but it really affected me much to hear that she had been converted. The more I see of life -- the more deeply I learn to [prise?] not merely the self communion with God but that spiritual communion of [illegible] people in their daily conversation. That scarcely exists here -- theology a plenty but no personal piety [illegible] [illegible] upon the notice. I am very glad to hear of Ste's gallant conquests of Greek & Latin & hope Willie is only resting on his [illegible]. I dropped Nan a line the other day as she is now separated from you all and I am very anxious to see & [learn?] more of Hetty. Could you get a likeness of her taken & sent me. Wm Trapmann would send it through his relations. I send you an envelope which brought a letter to me lately. You can show it to Aunt Betseys family also, & it will account for the loss of letters which are not directed very plainly -- and with this I must close. We attend a great dinner tomorrow given by our \"landlord\" in celebration[End Page 4]"
