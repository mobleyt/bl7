      "value": "Cheraw June 15th 1865 that destroyed the city & he hopes to get on. Notwithstanding the times, so does Bro Francis who has lost extensively, but retains his cheerful & bouyant [sic] disposition. I hope they may realize their expectations. The Nuns occupy the Methodist Female Academy, at present. I suppose, you know, they were burnt out & lost everything in the fire. They have a pretty fair school & Sister Ellen writes quite cheerfully. Conlaw is at home, a paroled prisoner, came over here a few days ago to remain with Bro Francis. We hear nothing from Sister Mary. Brother we understand is soon expected home that Revd Mr. Moore received intelligence to that effect from Archbishop Spaulding [?]. We would all be rejoiced to have him at home, again, under other circumstances, but in[End Page 1] the present state of affairs, would much prefer his remaining away a few months longer since he went at all, & has been away so long. I do not know Bros address, so cannot write to him, but suppose you correspond with him Independently of others & perhaps more important reasons which I do not assign, he may wish a great deal in returning to the city in Yellow Fever season. I regret very much now that he went away at all, except that his health will be benefitted by the change & [illegible] and he has escaped witnessing much that is disagreeable & distressing at home. Of course I do not mean in his immediate family alone. We have been favored in never having been deprived of our wants either during the war, or since. [illegible]. I hope communication will soon be resumed & we will hear from you. None of our Negroes left us but as they are free now we may not keep all in our employment. I will conclude begging your fervant [sic] prayers For Father, Mother & all of the family for myself especially. I sincerely hope we will be able soon to welcome Brother home once more. All are well. Pray for your Sister. Anna[End Page 2]"
