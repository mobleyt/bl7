      "value": "Hdqrs 3rd Sub District S.C. James Island February 4th 1865 Dear Ted Not having heard of you except in an incidental manner, for some time past, I have undertaken to extract a letter from you, as the shortest method of getting at your present doings and ideas generally. I suppose that you were not at all unwilling to accompany the general back to Columbia even should your stay there only be short for if I remember rightly you were not given much time to make arrangements when ordered off. Indeed before I left you I had strong suspicions that the romance of the thing was wearing off and that Gen Chestnut would not be likely to neglect any suitable opportunity of taking a breathing spell before the campaign in Carolina fairly commenced. I hope that he is well and would be glad if you will remember me to him, as also to Hayne. I have retained very pleasant feelings in connection with my short stay upon his staff and did not at first realize[End Page 1] the change to Jim Island, of which I had not got very favourable impressions. I must however acknowledge to have been very agreeably disappointed, as since my arrival I have had a continually pleasant time, indeed I am better and more comfortably fixed than I have ever been since my entrance in the service. Capt Desaussure has reported here for duty on an application of Gen Elliott and is hard at work in the A.A. Genl's office reducing things to a point. He certainly is a nice gentleman generally speaking and very efficient but somehow I don't think that he meets my idea of an agreeable companion -- indeed he is too formal and has too much of the red-tape about him to suit my rather informal manners and it is rather amusing when we have any business intercourse. How did you like him when on the staff together and what do you think of his capacity -- not as a worker -- for that is [appearant] -- but in [illegible] comprehension. How are military matters progressing in your parts? Have any plans been yet made? Do the authorities seem to have[End Page 2] determined upon any single course of action and do they give any evidence of a determination to work with a reasonable amount of energy? for if they do and such plans have been made it is more than I would dare assert for our leaders down here -- from my standpoint or from information that I am able to obtain from those around me. I can not conceive of a more pressing emergency than is at present upon us nor do I believe there ever existed a greater need for some one man, fit to direct our disarranged affairs and [control?] our misapplied energy. Why do you believe it possible -- when I inform you that we are working here like beavers yet do not know whether we may not get an order to evacuate at any moment, which when it comes can have of course but one result and that is to demoralize the troops. We had the usual routine broken through yesterday by the arrival of 4 deserters from a mortar schooner in Folly River. 2 of them formerly in our service and 2 of them foreigners. They report that the enemy is perfectly confident of the success of their programme which[End Page 3] seems to be the investing of Charleston by Shermans Forces in the rear and thus compelling its evacuation -- or arranging their forces for a double attack by land & water, which they anticipate as of easy success. From conversations with these deserters it is evident that, as far as their information extends, that the common soldiers would readily cease hostilities on any terms not dishonorable to themselves and are anxious to be relieved from the necessities of facing the bullets, but that they are entirely under the control of their leaders & officers, all of [whom?] confidentially state that altho the Confederacy may hold out a little longer, that it is evidently on its last legs and will be obliged to come back into the Union. There is no doubt about it we are in a tight box but I believe a sicker chicken can be cured -- and my motto is \"pitch in lemons if you do get squeezed. Do inform Bet and Joseph that I received their letters and will answer, if communication is not cut. Tell Joseph he forgot to enclose his signature. Remember me to all at home and to Hattie and the boys, I wish you all had as little to trouble you as I have -- indeed I regard the slight inconveniences as a single man during these times, of [comparatively?] small importance. Yrs Aff S E Barnwell[End Page 4]"
