      "value": "I write it as much to him as to you. To him both as my father, and my pastor. There is, it seems to me, a wonderful difference in the army this year, and last. There is so much more religious feeling and so much less profanity. Mr. Anderson has had more than 20 of the Regt. to join the various churches in the last week. He is a good man and has good influence on us all. Col. Miller joined the Presbyterian church last Sunday. [Lt.?] Col. Davis is an Episcopalian, and vestryman of a church in Fairfield, but he has never joined it. He says that if he had known I was going to this morning[End Page 1] he would have gone to Mr. Williams too, and he means to on the very next opportunity. Major Bookter has been pretty wild, but he in the last two or three weeks has become very serious, and even spoken to Mr. Anderson on the subject. Do give my love to Grandmama both Aunt Sarah, Cousin Lucy, and all. Remember me kindly to Dr. Borland. I must now close, as it time for our family evening prayers. Do write soon. Your Own Affectionate, W. [End Page 2]"
