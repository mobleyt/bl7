      "value": "Get Set For New Traffic Pa  Motorists of the Charleston area  \" should ready themseves for the new  pattern of .traffic that will go into effect Monday.  The  present  system,   instituted  last  September,  will  be  radicay atered,  and   drliving  habits   will   have   to  be  changed accordingy. City Council was  prevaied upon to abandon several features of the Smith-Dibbe plan and to   put a revised version to a 90-day test,  The principal change will be in connection with King and Meeting streets.  King  will revert   to   two-way   traffic  north of Calhoun. Beow Calhoun the  one-way direction will be reversed, with  cars going south.  \" Meeting  street   will   have   two-way  traffic again, with parking prohibited  on the least side from Broad to Mount  pleasant, to make way for four anes.  There are other changes in one-way  directions and in parking. unless motorists study the new plan in detai,  many  will find \" themseves   confused,  and cause more congestion and mix-  ups than would be the oaf? if they took  the precaution of fixing the new setup in their -minds. At the best, there is  bound to be some confusion, but if motorists cooperate, it carf be held to a  minimum.  while some groups and a number of  f     EVENiNvS POST\"  aHARESTON, S, CMB 3 \"S  individuals, voiced disike of the system which went into operation last  September, city counci\"s decision to  abandan some \"of its major features met\"  with far-from unanimous Public approva. Many motorists and a substantial number of non-drivers were satisfied with the way\" the Smith-Dibba  plan had worked out in actua experience.  The engineers who had drafted the  plan recommended, after a survey, that  it be retained. They outined aternate  plans; however, in event that the city  authorities should not accept their recommendation. It, is one of these, aternates that will go on test starting Mon -  day. It is sated for a three-month tria.  If   it   proves   disappointing,   the   presumption is that it, too, will be scrapped,  and that a pattern simiar to the now  expiring one will be adopted.\"  The Public, including those who are  opposed to the change, should cooperate in every way possibe, and give the  plan fu opportunityto prove its worth  or revea its inadequacy. The test, in  this newspaper\"s Opinion, will be in the  extent to which it faciitates the flow  of traffic, eases congestion, and essens  the ikeihood of accidents. If it succeeds, it will justify itself; if not, city  Council should call it off."
