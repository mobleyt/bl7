      "value": "Charleston July 24th 1851 Dear Mamma, Again and again have we all wished for some tidings of you - but have come to the conclusion, that not hearing from or of you, is equivalent to your being well -- if otherwise, certainly we should hear -- I suppose you have long ago received Ellen's letter to you -- written before she left us -- and here I must offer my own excuse, for not writing you before -- soon after you left it was determined upon for Ellen to return to Montpelier, then of course I was very much engaged making things ready for her departure, for those also who accompanied her - Mr. M, Tam & Withers & then with the daily expectations (I had) of a withdrawal from making [illegible] in behalf of the family) It seemed to me that each day, had some special object to be accomplished, & thus I have been carried along, until the present time -- entirely contrary as you know to my expectations. Mr. Memminger & the boys returned on Tuesday last of this week -- very much pleased with their visit to Montpelier, giving us most pleasing accounts of its cool Buncombe like climate, freedom from mosquitos and very fine fruit -- of which indeed we had a specimen. The Bishop with much kindness had some very fine peaches, & a bunch of grapes[End Page 1] packed in a box & sent to me - the peaches were remarkably fine & when fully ripe would be equal to any. Ellen was pretty well, not entirely recovered from headache, the effective part of seasickness & railroad travelling, but she had slept well and was in good spirits -- found them all glad to see her return. The Bishop proposed giving her separate, individual, instruction -- he says this to avoid excitement as recitations in a class necessarily produces -- it is an excellent plan, kindly thought of, made for my dear Ellen. I sincerely trust that her being at this Institute will prove a blessing for her. Miss Hetty Elliot, the Bishop's sister, is to pass the summer with them. It has been raining much this morning -- rather unfortunate for Virginia's move today -- they commenced yesterday & are to make a [push?] today. [illegible] she contemplates remaining down there to dinner & come up this afternoon, towards evening for Hope & Jinnie [?], the nurse & Allard - who remain here until then. We shall miss them all very much - we have spent a pleasant time together I believe -- for ourselves I can speak with certainty. I hope they will enjoy an increase of happiness in their new Home -- their garden has been affording us some nice fruit - apricots, peaches, & nectarines - the have been very fine, somewhat deterring but a little care no doubt will improve them. the apricots are very fine -- [illegible] some peaches. Stanner and some of her children where here for a little while[End Page 2] yesterday afternoon -- she comes frequently in this way -- the children come round to join ours, in the garden & she comes sometimes with them & sometimes calls in to take them home a little before, sometimes, after tea. She got a long & pleasing letter from [M. Hetta?] day before yesterday, and one from Maria - who I am happy to say - they report - quite well & always in good spirits -- they were at the [Fauquier?] Spring, Va. A few days ago Virginia got a letter from Sarah at the same place, & spoke of her luxuriating with the sulphur water - that it had greatly improved her appetite & she seemed altogether in good spirits, b ut would be glad to get back the last of August to Norfolk & spend the rest of her time there pleasantly and quietly with Uncle Jesse's family. We had last night, an unexpected visit & introduction to a Dr. Borland -- who claims relationship with us -- he is a descendant of the Godwins & Wilkinsons too I think his mother was a Wilkinson -- Virginia [illegible] recognized his name, as a person Lucy had often spoken of -- he is now living in Louisiana, a sugar planter -- was in the Navy, acquainted well with Uncle Jesse & family & passing as he was through the city on his way to Virginia Springs -- he met with Mr. George Logan, who is staying at the hotel, finding him acquainted with Mr. M. & our family, he requested him to come with him & introduce him -- he wished to see some of the family. Mr. Memminger is acquainted with a brother of his (Senator from Arkansas or Missouri I don't know which -- he is a widower -- lost [illegible] the last twelve months, his wife[End Page 3] and 3 children - has only now 2 sons one of 12 & the other 7 years of age. We were all agreeably impressed with this our new cousin. He is intelligent, with a good deal of information & very good appearance & manners. [Place?] style. He leaves today -- or else we would have invited him to dinner. And how are all with you. Your own health has it improved & James's family how are they? Sarah's health too I hope has been benefitted. Do Mamma if you can find time write if only a few lines to let us know how you all are -- however so long as we do not hear, we shall conclude that that all well. Does William come over sometimes? And how do James & himself like country life? Virginia says I must give you much love and say that she will write as soon as she gets settled. We had a pleasant visit an evening last week from Mr. Shackelford -- he was very much pleased with his visit into the interior -- found it also profitable & beneficial & he looks extremely well & is in excellent spirits -- on Saturday he had an increase of [illegible] in the addition of another daughter -- Clara Jane. Stanna had seen Elise found her doing well in every respect & getting an admirably -- Virginia & Mr. Belin have been sitting a short time here in my room & have bid goodbye & are actually off. I am sorry to part with them. My writing is so bad, together with little Virginia's blots, while I was away, that I fear you will find difficulty in reading my letter. Be sure Mamma & not let any but yourself see these lines & do not read out just as I have written -- for I have written totally without care -- so only speak of such things, as may be worth a recital -- though no [illegible] is for cause of interest but to yourself. Give my love to Sarah, James, the boys, & little Ella. Your affectionate daughter M M [End Page 4]"
