      "value": "5\nMarch I5th '45\nSidney Darling,\nIn answer to your number ? March 8th-\nI am glad you get the United States News. I saw Freddie Orschner\ntoday outside the building and we had a long talk. He is getting fed up r\nwith desk work and wants to go back to newspaper reporting at the frontt.\nHe gave me to beleive he was going to leave this nut factory soon.\nNext week he is off for New Urleans and hoped to see Armant down there.\n1 have heard nothing furthur from Armant and do not know what his plans\nare or how they have developed. _ '\nPeople who have been trying to get off to the fronts\nfrom this officeare stlllhere. No one eber seems to get off anywhere.\nThere is so much friction- jealousles etc. 1 beleive the war will be\nover in H.A. before a single office force arrives. _\nNow that I am back at my 'desk 'L feel as though 1 had\nI never been away.It all seems so natural and routine.\nJy flight up with my guests yesterday was super. Terribly\nfast, and perfect flying. We took a ride in the morning as we had\ndone every day and we poked along in the sunshine and purred like\ncats. The Field Liarshal really looked rested from his trip and so\ndid we all. _ -\nHr`Lowndes came to dinner the last night and told some\nheayenly tales- Une about the negroe who wanted to know how much\nincome tax he should pay because he had 4 wives. \"[number]3 uncommon Law, and\nI Church Law\", He was very entertaining with that wonderful drawl\nand the field Marshal told some amusing ones too. We all longed fpr\nI you and wished you had been there with us. That night some stray\ncows really wrecked our sleep by clanking up the drive way with cow bells\ncrashing and preceded to munch grass by the dark room,Such a racket you\nhave never heard, I got up at 3,30 to chase them.away and they left f\nfor a bit wnile L got back to sleep.again ,but ebidently they returned\nand nobody closed an eye. It was a shame but so typical dont you think ?\nI did not have that frustrated feeling as 1 did not try\n_ to do anything or be efflcient.I felt however the place was shut in,\nThe flowers were not in bloom yet,yet l caught a tick that itches me\nnow like the devil. It all had great charm,'13he negroes were pleasant\na nd nice and everything looked a bit shoddy and run down. I guess\nwe all were so weary we did n't care at all] but -L think the -Ullls had\na bit of a shock there was no lawn anyuhbre, The grass if anything has\ndied out during 'the drought they have had. rlverythlng is burnt to a c\nPcinderl ang think ass amazing the cattle look as well as they do. They\nhave not Q, ne di yet. They are fed hay every day and so look O.K. \nWalter says he understands the planting as he is the one \nthat has done the work all along.As he needs an other hand I hope Bingley\nis return will be alright. I feel that as it was Platt and not you that\nfired him that perhaps it would be' alrighf. he is good and handy with  \ntools and can meand things. ----- '? Maybe could put him in the gate \n_house ? what dp you think?\nWe hope to kill the Sectionmen's houses being moved on  \nour road and I think we can. We shall lock the gate so they can not use\nthe road and then let Nature take its course.\n[End Page 1]\n2\nI had a phone call from Liola Armour to-day so I shall see\nLester soon. They are staying at the Anchorage and caan not wait to see\nhim and hear all about you. \nDarling please let me remind you and hound you somemore about\nthose photos.I was so dissappointed to just find a picture of a crumppled\nbed,and one of Morris with a cigar. Where are the ones of you-'YOU- and\na few of the beach? You promised them to me- please. I want them`so. YOU\ntell me you have a large tummie and that your belt is tight over it.I\nhope you look well and feel well my darling. How is that old back of yours?\nI often think of bt and those ghastly falls at Harford when you put\nit out. Such a mistake that hunting was. In fact as you say you have\nreally done so many nasty things that you hated doing that   immagine -\nwork in Hawaii is pretty nice by oomparison.I am sure you enjoy the _\naccomplishment,and sense of doing something,that you have always wanted.\nI guess I was gust born without that ambition as i never want\nto see a desk again when get through this war. This time ets reverse\nthe picture and if you want a desk lige lets live it that way,beoause\nfor I5 years you have done it my way nd now 1 am beginning to learn\ndisg glin -doing things _ hate doing,and being places hate being,and\ndoi eAanyway. My i thought the birds, the trees, the blue skye A\nwas heaven. I lay on.a matress all one afternoon in the sunshine and\nwqtohed the big white puffy cloudssadng across the skye and merge together.\nFortunately the U111s would just take little stroles and return at tea\ntime and they too enjoyed the bluebirds and the oardinels, the sqnirrells\nand the lizards. We saw a coon with his tail staright up in the air paddling\ndown a road ahead of us completely oblivious to everything. We saw dear\nhand turkey but no quail. I was truly yorry it could not have been_4 days\nlonger as everything was about to burst open at the end of that week of\nwarm weather and sunshine, and you know how the British appreciate flwers-\n-they love them.\n' I am afraid I was unable to talk racing with the Field Marshal\nwhich I think surprised hlm,for ofcourse with Seargent Murphy in the family\nthey believe you should know eberything.-Also my memory is rotten when I\ntry and recall the names of th places we had in England etc etc. l really\nhave no memory at all. I am asgmed of it. They both loved riding Qevorcée\nand thought her sweet and such nice manners. Uld \"dam was charming, and\ntold us all about the weather forcast and pointed to his dog on the stable\nroof that he consults. All the negroes asked about you and want to be \nremembered to you.Mr and Mrs Lowndes, Mr Mrs Kittredge and old Nanny Tiffany. \nalso talked and asked and wanted to be remembered yo you both.\nIf old Medway stands up inspite of its ceiling cracks, wall cracks \nand continual process of disintergration we will be able to go there\nand relax and think aboutwwhat we want to do with our lives when this \nwar finally is all over. 1 think it should be kept as a simple place, \nand our good furniture taken elsewhere. Qc much becomes unglued and \nspoiled in that dampness and I believe \"edwqy should be run by the happy\ncare free easy going negroes and the only thing we should struggle over \nis a lawn. Shall I try having that lawn reseeded this year with permanent\ngrass if I can get lt. Its just plane earth except for a patch in front\nof the porch. '  \nI payed my income tax both federal and State. The Staete \none as last year in Colombia. George Buist said I should pay my federal\nin Colombia next year too. The Guaranty had handled yours Loomis Sayles\nhas bought and sold somemore for you. They have notifyed you also.\nGood-bye until to-morrow- you- Gertie who sends all her love.\n[End Page 2]"
