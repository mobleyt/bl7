      "value": "THE ALE BOYCOTT.\n\nThirteen Bar Rooms Reported for Keeping Open on Sunday Waging War on Tracy [and] Russell.\n\nThe boycott which has been declared against Tracy [and] Russell's ale by the Central Labor Union of this city assumed new and interesting proportions yesterday. As has already been announced, the members of the union have been bound to boycott any dealers who handle the ale made by this company, and it has been pretty rigidly enforced during the past week or ten days. The union does not seem satisfied with this action, however, and last week a committee, consisting of M. Kelly, E. Dukes, A. Logan, Henry Smith, T. P. Vaughn, N. Johnson, J. H. Saunders, P. F. Johnson and W. H. Sutcliffe, was appointed to conduct further hostilities against the offending dealers. Yesterday morning their plan of campaign was made public. \n\nAt about 1 o'clock the officer of the day at the Central Police Station was surprised to receive a visit from the gentlemen above mentioned, who announced the object of their visit to report the following saloons as being open in violation of Sunday laws: \nSchultz Bros, at the corner of Calhoun and Anson streets. \nA. F. Wist, corner of George and Anson streets.\nH. Tiedeman, corner of Laurens and Anson streets.\nH. Kruger, corner of Middle and Minority streets.\nSchultz Bros, corner of East Bay and Calhoun streets.\nF. L. Hackerman, corner of Bogard street and Rutledge avenue.\nH. Nolte, 26 Vanderhorst street.\nP. N. Gorse, corner of Calhoun and Middle streets.\nJ. F. Koester, corner of Washington and Calhoun streets.\nC. H. Blase, corner of America and Reid streets.\nC. H. G. Belhmer, corner of Columbus and Aiken streets.\nL. C. Kangeter, corner of Line and Meeting streets.\nC. A. Camman, southwest corner of Line and Meeting streets.\n\nThe methods adopted by the committee were exceedingly simple. The members quietly walked around town, and entered in a most innocent way the little side doors of the various bars and asked for drinks, some, occasionally all, asking for ale. If they were served with the boycotted article they only winked at each other, drank it off, paid the damages, and when they got outside put the proprietor's name on their little list, and a few hours later reported him at the Police Station. Of course the proprietors were ignorant of the trap they were falling into, or they would either have refused to sell them anything, or else have stated that they did not handle the boycotted ale. \n\nThe committee went to different parts of the city, some of the reports being against dealers in Rutledge avenue as far as Bogard street, and others over on the Cooper River side of the city.\n\nThe cases will be heard before Recorder Pringle this morning at 9 o'clock. It is said that the majority of the defendants will demand a jury trial. The Merchants' Protective Union will probably take a hand in the defence, and the cases will no doubt be interesting as one union will be arrayed against the other. As the dealers are all banded together, it is hardly probably that they cases will be settled without considerable litigation. \n[End Page 1]\nThirteen Liquor Dealers in Court for Violating the Sunday Liquor Laws The Cases Referred to the April Term of the City Court The Fight to Continue. \n\nThe cases against the thirteen saloon keepers who were reported by the Knights of Labor boycott committee for violating the Sunday liquor laws came up before Recorder Pringle yesterday morning.\n\nMr. J. D. Cappelmann appeared for all of the defendants excepting Mr. A. F. Witt, who was represented by Mr. Jas Simons.\n\nThe counsel for the defendants demanded that the cases be referred to the City Court, and each of the thirteen defendants were placed under bond to appear before the City Court at the April term.\n\nMessrs M. Kelly and T. P. Vaughn, representing the boycotting party, were present at the hearing of the case. They declared that it was the purpose of the Union to push the cases on to a close and, if possible, win them. \n\nThe committee which has the management of the boycott consists of Messrs M. Kelly, E. Dukes, A. Logan, Henry Smith, T. P. Vaughn, N. Johnson, J. H. Saunders, P. F. Johnson and W. H. Sutcliffe. \n\nA Knight of Labor said to a Reporter yesterday that the fight would be pushed to the bitter end, and that the committee would be doubled next Sunday. A meeting of the Union will be held to night to discuss the situation and raise the sinews of war. A committee called on Gen McCrady yesterday, and another committee was also sent to the Ministerial Union. The fight promises to be long and fierce.\n\nThey Only Looked On.\n\nTo the Editor of The News and Courier: In to day's paper it is stated that occasionally all the boycotting committee called for ale. Both of the undersigned are total abstainers, and did not call for or drink any intoxicating liquors. Please make this statement.\n\nRespectfully,\nMarch 3, 1890\nT. P. Vaughan,\nW. H. Sutcliffe\n[End Page 2]"
