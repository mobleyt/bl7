Bill Taylor\na captain in the naval air [illegible] just arrived\nin Italy - it was such a surprise [and] an \nun expected to hear again all about the outside\nworld - he saw Sidney in Hawaii ages ago -\nyesterday a very nice little Ameri can General\ncam down from Naples bringing Fiskes'\nsister a friend of ours - she spent the night [and]\nthey gave us incredible presents , the prize of\nold kings one of these [illegible] against [illegible] worth\nits weight in gold here now_\nWe went up to the north as I told you [and]\nfound the property all [illegible] including the\nPackerd [illegible] in the garage from the Germans\nfor five years _ [and] we actually drove hardly to of the\nno its 500 kilometers quite a record - one destructive\nthough upstairs is heart renching - it looks as though\nit would take 50 yrs to build it all up - every\nbridge, railroad house for kinds _ [and] every thing seems\nin a chaotic state of [illegible]  [and] unrest we\ntried not send the family up there - its too dangerous\n[illegible] shooting . [and] sudden death all among the partisans\n[illegible] etc there is no law or order [and] with the\nlabor govrt. in England god knows what will happen\nits all most depressing [and] am glad we are down in this lovely\nspot away from all politics. Tonight there was a village\nfiesta with lights processions music, saints [and] candles [and] all\nlooked like an opera scene [and] most peaceful.\nI had a little farm - from [and] in the same wail about my visa\nbut the transports is the great difficulty after I get it\n[and] then one can't get back [and] forth as you seem to think , but\nwould like to come to America - it may take ages - but we're hoping\n[and] Please write again soon - I love getting letters - heaps of love to you [and] Sidney [and] Landine\n[and] Bo _ [illegible] Janie\nThis pen [and] ink are fierce'!\n[End Page 3]"
