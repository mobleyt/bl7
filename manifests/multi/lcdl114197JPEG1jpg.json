      "value": "The Citadel,\nMarch 4, 1930\n\nDear Miss Bragg:\n\n\tby this time you probably are about to leave New Orleans for Texas and I hope this letter will wait for you at Brooks Field, San Antonio before your arrival at this place\n\n\tNow, week end (sic) is setting in and I begin to feel the difference of your being at home and your going away. To-morrow ro day after to-morrow I will pay a visit to Miss Richardson and Mrs. House. I-men probably will go with me.\n\n\tAfter you left, we have had only two raining days, but the weather has been beautifully warm and an amiable spring has at last come. But I am sorry that we cannot enjoy such a fine seaston.\n\n\tIn school everything goes on as usual except that I just recently received a reward, from the Commandant, of five demerits and ten confinements because of my taking a day to bemoan my late father. This is a bygone matter and I can never think that he will take it up again. He censures me for my having not borne my sorrow in a military manner. This I believe, I can do easily in war but not in peace time. I do not care his punishment which means nothing to me. What I do not [2] approve is that the military training in time of peace should aim at an entire elimination of human emotion and feeling. Such kind of military education is bound to produce war since the military class of a country, nurtured by their training, always welcomes war and even is quite willing to create war. The present London Naval Conference, I think, must receive a centralized keen interest of all the military classes of the big three or five powers. Whatever result, whether a failure or success, that conference will produce, another world war may be effected in one way or another. But I hope it may not.\n\n\tYesterday I did something for myself; that is a definite decision to go to Harvard University this summer. I believe, I will not change my mind and nothing can make me change. I feel I have had enough military training, and what I am yearning for is knowledge - too much being military seems to me a sheer ignorance. This case is especially true of China, and I dare not allow myself to be a mere military man as our Commandant tries to train me to be.\n\n\tHoping you enjoy an exceedingly fine trip.\n\n\tYours affectionately,\n\n\tFong Lee\n[3]\n[P.S.] With my kindliest regards to Chai Mei\n\tF.L.W."
